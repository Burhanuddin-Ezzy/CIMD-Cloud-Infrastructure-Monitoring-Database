# Alternative Approaches

- **Storing alerts in a NoSQL database (e.g., Elasticsearch)** for better real-time processing.
    - **Why?** Relational databases can struggle with high-velocity alert data, especially in large-scale infrastructure. NoSQL solutions like **Elasticsearch** allow for **fast full-text search, real-time analytics, and distributed scaling**.
    - **Trade-offs:** While Elasticsearch improves speed, it lacks strong ACID compliance, making it less ideal for transactional consistency.
- **Using an event-driven architecture (Kafka or RabbitMQ) to handle alerts dynamically.**
    - **Why?** Traditional databases store alerts **after** they occur, but an **event-driven system** allows **real-time alert processing**, **automated responses**, and **streaming analytics**.
    - **How?** Kafka or RabbitMQ can stream alerts to different consumers like:
        - A **notification service** to send real-time alerts via email/SMS/Slack.
        - A **machine learning anomaly detection service** to predict future failures.
        - A **dashboard for live monitoring of system health.**
    - **Trade-offs:** Event-driven architecture adds **complexity** and requires **additional infrastructure** (Kafka clusters, message queues).
- **Keeping only critical alerts in the database and logging others to a file.**
    - **Why?** Not all alerts require **immediate investigation**. Low-priority alerts (e.g., **slight CPU spikes**) can be stored in logs instead of **overloading the database**.
    - **Implementation:**
        - Store **high-priority alerts** (`disk failure`, `network outage`) in `alert_history`.
        - Log **low-priority alerts** (`CPU usage above 70%`) to a file or a **log aggregator (e.g., Loki, Fluentd, or Graylog)**.
    - **Trade-offs:** Querying historical low-priority alerts becomes harder since logs aren’t as easily queryable as a database.
- **Implementing Time-To-Live (TTL) for Alerts in the Database.**
    - **Why?** Keeping alerts indefinitely causes **database bloat**. A **TTL strategy** ensures only relevant alerts are kept.
    - **How?**
        - **Example:** Configure PostgreSQL's `pg_partman` or a cron job to delete alerts **older than 90 days**.
    - **Trade-offs:** Older alert data becomes **less accessible**, but helps **maintain high query performance**.
- **Storing Alerts in a Columnar Database (e.g., ClickHouse) for Faster Aggregations.**
    - **Why?** Columnar databases like **ClickHouse** excel at **storing and aggregating time-series alert data** efficiently, making them **faster than PostgreSQL** for analytics.
    - **Trade-offs:** While **query performance is superior**, columnar databases are not ideal for **transactional workloads**.

### **Which Approach Is Best?**

- If **real-time alerts and automation** are a priority → **Use Kafka for event-driven processing.**
- If **fast querying of historical alerts** is needed → **Use Elasticsearch or ClickHouse.**
- If **reducing database storage costs** is key → **Log less critical alerts instead of storing them in PostgreSQL.**
- If **balancing structured and unstructured alert data** → **Hybrid approach: PostgreSQL + log storage.**
