# How It Interacts with Other Tables

- **Joins with `server_metrics`** to correlate alerts with server performance data.
    - **Why**: By linking the `alert_history` table with `server_metrics`, I can correlate specific server health issues that triggered alerts (such as CPU overload or memory issues) with the server's performance data. This helps in identifying recurring performance issues, verifying if alerts are indeed caused by performance degradation, and fine-tuning thresholds to improve monitoring.
- **Joins with `downtime_logs`** to determine if alerts led to downtime.
    - **Why**: Linking `alert_history` with `downtime_logs` allows me to track whether any particular alert escalated into actual system downtime. By associating alerts with specific downtime events, I can perform root cause analysis to understand if alerts are timely and effective in preventing service outages. This also helps in post-incident reviews and evaluating how well the system responded to alerts.
- **Joins with `error_logs`** to check if an alert resulted in an error.
    - **Why**: By joining the `alert_history` with `error_logs`, I can track whether an alert corresponds to an error in the system. This helps in validating the effectiveness of the alerts in identifying critical issues that need immediate attention. If an alert leads to an error, this provides useful insights into the health of the system and potential improvements to alerting thresholds or mitigation strategies.
- **Joins with `resource_allocation`** to evaluate if resource allocation issues contributed to the alert.
    - **Why**: If alerts are related to resource exhaustion (e.g., memory or CPU), joining with the `resource_allocation` table can help identify if inadequate resource allocation contributed to the alert. By comparing allocated resources with actual usage at the time of the alert, I can fine-tune allocation to prevent future incidents.
- **Joins with `incident_response_logs`** to analyze how effectively the alert was addressed.
    - **Why**: By linking alerts to incident response logs, I can assess how quickly and effectively the incident was handled. This helps in improving incident response times and tracking if alerts are being acted on in a timely manner. This analysis can also inform improvements in automation or response procedures.
- **Joins with `team_management`** to track which team was responsible for resolving the alert.
    - **Why**: By connecting the `alert_history` table with the `team_management` table, I can track which team or individual handled a specific alert. This can be useful for understanding team performance, identifying potential gaps in knowledge, and ensuring that the right teams are assigned to critical alerts based on expertise.
- **Joins with `billing_data`** to assess if alert-related incidents had any financial impact.
    - **Why**: If an alert results in a system failure or downtime, it may lead to business impacts that have financial consequences. By linking alerts with `billing_data`, I can analyze if and how alert-triggered incidents affect operational costs, such as downtime penalties, lost revenue, or increased resource consumption during incident resolution. This data can help in improving cost forecasting and alerting thresholds.
