# Real-World Use Cases

- **Incident Management**: Helps teams track and resolve system issues.
    - **Why?** Organizations need a structured **alert history** to investigate past incidents, determine root causes, and prevent recurring failures.
    - **How?**
        - **Correlate alerts with error logs** to find patterns (e.g., CPU spikes causing application crashes).
        - **Integrate with incident tracking tools** like **Jira, ServiceNow, or PagerDuty** to assign alerts to IT teams automatically.
        - **Set escalation policies** where unresolved alerts get automatically assigned to a senior engineer after a certain time.
    - **Example:**
        - A **database server crash** triggers an **automated PagerDuty notification**, linking engineers directly to relevant logs.
- **Proactive Maintenance**: Identifies recurring performance bottlenecks.
    - **Why?** Instead of waiting for failures, analyzing historical alerts allows for **predictive maintenance** and **infrastructure scaling**.
    - **How?**
        - Use **trend analysis** to detect if a server’s memory consumption steadily increases over time.
        - Set **custom thresholds** to trigger alerts **before** critical failures occur (e.g., warning at **80% disk usage**, alert at **95% disk usage**).
        - Automate **scaling decisions** based on recurring alert patterns (e.g., auto-provisioning new servers when CPU alerts exceed a certain threshold).
    - **Example:**
        - Detecting **gradual CPU degradation** on a server and replacing hardware before it fails.
- **SLA Compliance**: Measures response times for alert resolutions.
    - **Why?** Companies with **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)** must **meet uptime guarantees**. Tracking alert resolution time ensures compliance.
    - **How?**
        - Use **SQL queries** to measure **Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)** and **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**.
        - Set **automated reminders** for unresolved alerts exceeding the SLA time limit.
        - Generate **weekly/monthly reports** showing how many alerts were resolved within SLA limits.
    - **Example:**
        - A cloud provider guarantees **99.9% uptime** and uses alert resolution logs to **prove SLA compliance** to clients.
- **Security Monitoring & Intrusion Detection**:
    - **Why?** Security breaches often start with **unusual system behavior** (e.g., high CPU from a cryptominer, excessive failed logins).
    - **How?**
        - Link **alert history** with security logs (SIEM tools like Splunk or ELK).
        - Generate alerts for **unusual traffic spikes** that may indicate **DDoS attacks**.
        - Automate **temporary server lockdowns** if repeated security alerts occur.
    - **Example:**
        - Detecting **unauthorized SSH attempts** and triggering an alert to block the attacker’s IP.
- **Capacity Planning & Cost Optimization**:
    - **Why?** Helps companies forecast infrastructure needs **based on past alert data** (e.g., consistent CPU overloads indicate a need for scaling).
    - **How?**
        - Identify servers that **frequently trigger high-memory usage alerts**.
        - Adjust **resource allocation** based on past performance trends.
        - Generate **predictive cost analysis reports** based on recurring alerts.
    - **Example:**
        - A company uses **historical alert data** to determine that **weekend traffic spikes** require temporary scaling.
- **Regulatory Compliance & Audit Trails**:
    - **Why?** Industries like **finance and healthcare** require **detailed alert history** for compliance with laws like **HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2**.
    - **How?**
        - Store **immutable alert logs** to prove **no tampering** occurred.
        - Log **who resolved an alert** and **what actions were taken**.
        - Provide **audit reports** to regulatory bodies upon request.
    - **Example:**
        - A bank keeps **detailed logs of alert resolutions** to prove security incidents were handled within required timeframes.
