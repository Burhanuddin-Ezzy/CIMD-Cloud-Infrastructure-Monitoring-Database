# How It Interacts with Other Tables

1. **Joins with `server_metrics`**
    - **Purpose**: To determine which team is responsible for monitoring a server's health.
    - **How It Works**: By linking `team_management` with `server_metrics` via server IDs (either directly or through a linking table), you can query which team is managing a specific server's health metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage).
    - **Example Use Case**: If a server starts experiencing high CPU usage, the `server_metrics` table would provide the data, and `team_management` would tell you which team should be alerted.
2. **Links with `alerts_configuration` and `alert_history`**
    - **Purpose**: To notify the correct team when an alert is triggered.
    - **How It Works**: When an alert is triggered (e.g., high CPU or memory usage), the alert configuration (stored in `alerts_configuration`) can be used to determine which team is responsible for that server. The team’s contact email or other notification methods (stored in `team_management`) are then used for alert routing.
    - **Example Use Case**: If `alerts_configuration` triggers an alert based on specific threshold conditions (e.g., CPU > 90%), the relevant team from `team_management` is notified, and the alert history (`alert_history`) logs the incident for audit purposes.
3. **Joins with `cost_data`**
    - **Purpose**: To allocate cloud expenses to teams based on assigned servers.
    - **How It Works**: The team management table can be used to cross-reference which team is assigned to which server (via the `assigned_server_ids`), and these servers can then be linked with `cost_data` to allocate the cloud infrastructure costs to the appropriate team.
    - **Example Use Case**: By linking the `assigned_server_ids` field to `cost_data`, each team can be charged for the resources their servers are consuming (e.g., storage, compute), enabling **cost transparency** and **accountability** across teams.
4. **Integrates with `user_access_logs`**
    - **Purpose**: To monitor which teams access which servers.
    - **How It Works**: `user_access_logs` tracks the actions of users accessing specific servers. By linking `user_access_logs` with `team_management`, you can track which teams have access to which servers, ensuring **clear audit trails** and **team-based access control**.
    - **Example Use Case**: If an unauthorized team member accesses a server they shouldn’t be working on, security or IT operations can identify the violation and take action, ensuring **security** and **compliance**.
5. **Joins with `incident_response_logs`**
    - **Purpose**: To allocate incident responsibilities to teams based on server ownership.
    - **How It Works**: In the event of an incident (e.g., server downtime or critical failure), the `incident_response_logs` table will record the details. By linking `team_management` to these logs, you can quickly identify the team responsible for resolving the issue.
    - **Example Use Case**: If a critical incident occurs on a server, the `incident_response_logs` will show which team was assigned to the server, and the responsible team can be automatically escalated to handle the issue.

### **Summary of How It Interacts with Other Tables**:

- **Server Metrics**: Helps determine team responsibility for server health.
- **Alerts Configuration & Alert History**: Ensures correct team notification upon alert triggers.
- **Cost Data**: Allows the tracking of cloud expenses allocated to specific teams based on their servers.
- **User Access Logs**: Tracks which teams are accessing which servers for security purposes.
- **Incident Response Logs**: Allocates responsibility for incident resolution to the correct team.

By integrating **Team Management** with these tables, you ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined, actions are auditable, and teams are appropriately notified and held accountable for both operational issues and costs. This robust system enhances operational efficiency, security, and cost transparency, impressing employers by demonstrating strong governance in cloud infrastructure management.
