# Data Retention & Cleanup Strategy for Error Logs

To maintain a balance between performance, storage efficiency, and compliance, a structured data retention strategy is essential. Below are key components of this strategy:

---

### **1. Live Storage: Keeping Recent Logs for Real-Time Debugging**

- Retain **6 months** of error logs in PostgreSQL for **real-time debugging and monitoring**.
- These logs should be **indexed** and optimized for fast querying.
- **Table partitioning** by month can improve query performance and simplify data retention.

### **Partitioning Example:**

Partitioning the `error_logs` table by **month** ensures that older partitions can be easily dropped without affecting active data.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE TABLE error_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    server_id INT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_severity VARCHAR(20),
    resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);

```

Creating **monthly partitions**:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE TABLE error_logs_2025_01 PARTITION OF error_logs
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');

CREATE TABLE error_logs_2025_02 PARTITION OF error_logs
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-02-01') TO ('2025-03-01');

```

To ensure new partitions are created dynamically:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_next_partition()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    next_month TIMESTAMP;
    partition_name TEXT;
BEGIN
    next_month := date_trunc('month', NEW.timestamp) + INTERVAL '1 month';
    partition_name := 'error_logs_' || to_char(next_month, 'YYYY_MM');

    -- Create the next partition if it doesn't exist
    EXECUTE format(
        'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %I PARTITION OF error_logs FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L);',
        partition_name, next_month, next_month + INTERVAL '1 month'
    );

    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```

Then attach it as a trigger:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE TRIGGER partition_trigger
BEFORE INSERT ON error_logs
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION create_next_partition();

```

### **2. Cold Storage: Archiving Old Logs for Compliance & Long-Term Analysis**

After **6 months**, logs should be moved to a **cold storage solution** such as **AWS S3**, **Google BigQuery**, or **Azure Blob Storage** for long-term storage.

### **Archiving Process:**

1. **Extract logs older than 6 months**:
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    COPY (
        SELECT * FROM error_logs WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months'
    ) TO '/tmp/error_logs_archive.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
    
    ```
    
2. **Upload the CSV to Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3)**
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    aws s3 cp /tmp/error_logs_archive.csv s3://my-cloud-monitoring-logs/
    
    ```
    
3. **Load into BigQuery (if using GCP)**
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    bq load --source_format=CSV my_dataset.error_logs s3://my-cloud-monitoring-logs/error_logs_archive.csv
    
    ```
    

---

### **3. Automated Cleanup: Removing Old Logs from PostgreSQL**

To **remove logs past retention limits**, schedule a job to delete logs older than 6 months.

### **Scheduled Deletion Job Using PostgreSQL Cron Extension**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT cron.schedule(
    'monthly_cleanup',  -- Job name
    '0 0 1 * *',       -- Runs on the 1st of every month at midnight
    $$ DELETE FROM error_logs WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months' $$  -- Cleanup Query
);

```

- The `cron.schedule` function **automates deletion** of old logs.
- This ensures **storage is optimized** while retaining recent logs for real-time debugging.

---

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Using Table Inheritance Instead of Partitioning (For Simpler Management)**
    - A separate `error_logs_archive` table can be used to move data instead of deleting it.
    - Example:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE error_logs_archive (
            LIKE error_logs INCLUDING ALL
        );
        
        ```
        
    - Then, instead of `DELETE`, run:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        INSERT INTO error_logs_archive SELECT * FROM error_logs WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
        DELETE FROM error_logs WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
        
        ```
        
2. **Using Materialized Views for Aggregated Historical Data**
    - Instead of archiving raw logs, **precompute error trends** and **store summary reports**.
    - Example:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW error_summary AS
        SELECT error_message, COUNT(*) AS occurrences, DATE_TRUNC('month', timestamp) AS month
        FROM error_logs
        GROUP BY error_message, month;
        
        ```
        
    - This view can be refreshed weekly to keep track of historical error trends.

### **Summary**

| **Strategy** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Live Storage** | Retain logs for 6 months in PostgreSQL with indexing & partitioning |
| **Cold Storage** | Move logs older than 6 months to AWS S3, BigQuery, or another cloud storage |
| **Automated Cleanup** | Use PostgreSQL `cron` to remove old logs monthly |
| **Enhancements** | Table inheritance for archived logs, materialized views for error trends |

By implementing these **retention, archiving, and cleanup** strategies, your cloud monitoring system will remain **efficient, scalable, and cost-effective** while preserving critical error data for long-term analysis. ðŸš€
