# Error Logs

This table stores **error and failure events** occurring across servers. It is crucial for **debugging, monitoring system health, and identifying recurring issues**. By logging errors along with severity levels, timestamps, and resolution status, this table helps in **alerting, root cause analysis, and performance tuning**.

## **Data Points (Columns) – Purpose, Thought Process, and Data Type**

- **`error_id` (UUID)**
    
    **Purpose**: Unique identifier for each error log entry.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to uniquely track errors without duplication.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Ensures each error event is distinct, making referencing and debugging easier.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` to guarantee uniqueness, even in distributed logging systems.
    
- **`server_id` (UUID, Foreign Key)**
    
    **Purpose**: Links the error to the specific server where it occurred.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Essential for tracking which servers experience the most failures.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in troubleshooting server-specific problems and optimizing resource allocation.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` as it matches the `server_id` in the **Server Metrics** table, enabling easy joins.
    
- **`timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)**
    
    **Purpose**: Records when the error occurred.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Time-based analysis is crucial for identifying failure trends.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps correlate errors with server metrics (CPU spikes, memory leaks, etc.).
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `TIMESTAMP` for precise date-time tracking and efficient indexing.
    
- **`error_severity` (ENUM)**
    
    **Purpose**: Classifies the error’s severity (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL`).
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for prioritizing issues and alerting critical failures.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Prevents alert fatigue by allowing filtering based on severity.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `ENUM('INFO', 'WARNING', 'CRITICAL')` saves space and ensures standardized values.
    
- **`error_message` (TEXT)**
    
    **Purpose**: Stores a human-readable description of the error.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for debugging and root cause analysis.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps engineers quickly diagnose issues.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `TEXT` because error messages vary in length.
    
- **`resolved` (BOOLEAN)**
    
    **Purpose**: Indicates if the error has been resolved (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for tracking unresolved issues.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in filtering active problems vs. closed ones.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `BOOLEAN` as it’s a simple yes/no field.
    
- **`resolved_at` (TIMESTAMP, Nullable)**
    
    **Purpose**: Stores the timestamp when the error was resolved.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for performance auditing (how fast issues are resolved).
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in SLA tracking and improving response times.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `TIMESTAMP NULL` (null if unresolved, otherwise stores resolution time).
    
- **`incident_id` (UUID, Foreign Key, Nullable)**
    
    **Purpose**: Links the error log to an incident report (if applicable).
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Helps in tracking recurring or major issues tied to specific incidents.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables cross-referencing with **incident management** workflows.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID NULL`, making it optional for errors that don't trigger incident reports.
    
- **`error_source` (VARCHAR(100))**
    
    **Purpose**: Identifies the component or service responsible for the error (e.g., `database`, `API`, `network`).
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Helps in pinpointing where errors originate.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Aids in **root cause analysis** by distinguishing application vs. infrastructure issues.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(100)`, allowing flexibility in source identification.
    
- **`error_code` (VARCHAR(50), Nullable)**
    
    **Purpose**: Stores a standardized error code (if available).
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Some errors follow predefined codes (e.g., HTTP 500, database constraint violations).
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Makes filtering and debugging easier by grouping similar errors.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50) NULL`, as not all errors have a structured code.
    
- **`recovery_action` (VARCHAR(255), Nullable)**
    
    **Purpose**: Describes what action was taken to resolve the error.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for tracking corrective actions and optimizing resolution strategies.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps teams learn from past resolutions and automate recurring fixes.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(255) NULL`, allowing free-text descriptions when applicable.
