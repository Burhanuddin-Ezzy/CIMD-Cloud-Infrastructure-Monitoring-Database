# How Error Logs Interact with Other Tables

- **Server Metrics**
    - Links via `server_id` to correlate errors with **CPU/memory spikes, disk failures, or network issues**.
    - Example Query: Identify errors occurring when CPU usage exceeds 90%.
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT e.error_id, e.error_message, s.cpu_usage, e.timestamp
        FROM error_logs e
        JOIN server_metrics s ON e.server_id = s.server_id AND e.timestamp = s.timestamp
        WHERE s.cpu_usage > 90;
        
        ```
        
- **Alert History**
    - If `error_severity = 'CRITICAL'`, an entry is made in `alert_history`.
    - Used for tracking how many errors resulted in alerts and how they were handled.
    - Can help **fine-tune alert thresholds** to reduce false alarms.
- **Incident Response Logs**
    - Links via `error_id` to track the incident response process.
    - If a critical error is unresolved for a long time, an incident response team may be assigned.
    - Helps assess how **quickly engineers respond to and resolve major system failures**.
    - Example Query:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT e.error_id, e.error_message, i.response_time, i.resolution_status
        FROM error_logs e
        JOIN incident_response_logs i ON e.error_id = i.error_id
        WHERE e.error_severity = 'CRITICAL';
        
        ```
        
- **Downtime Logs**
    - If a critical error leads to service downtime, an entry is recorded in `downtime_logs`.
    - Helps determine **how often system failures cause outages**.
    - Used for SLA reporting and identifying recurring downtime causes.
- **Resource Allocation**
    - Helps identify if system errors occur due to **insufficient allocated resources** (CPU, memory, storage).
    - Can be used to **automatically scale resources** if errors frequently occur due to high load.
- **Cost Data**
    - Tracks how unresolved errors contribute to increased operational costs.
    - Example: If an error leads to **excessive compute resource usage**, it will reflect in the cost data.
    - Helps **optimize infrastructure costs** by identifying expensive recurring failures.
- **Aggregated Metrics**
    - Error trends can be **aggregated over time** to detect patterns.
    - Example: **Frequent errors after a deployment** may indicate buggy code updates.
    - Helps **predict failures before they cause major disruptions**.
- **Application Logs**
    - Provides **detailed debugging information** about errors, linking them to specific application events.
    - Helps determine if errors originate from **code bugs, misconfigurations, or external dependencies**.
- **User Access Logs**
    - Helps determine if certain **user actions trigger system errors**.
    - Useful for detecting **malicious activity or improper API usage** causing failures.
    - Example Query: Identify errors caused by a specific user before a system crash.
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT u.user_id, u.action, e.error_message, e.timestamp
        FROM user_access_logs u
        JOIN error_logs e ON u.timestamp = e.timestamp
        WHERE e.error_severity = 'CRITICAL';
        
        ```
        
- **Alerts Configuration**
    - Defines **which types of errors trigger alerts** and under what conditions.
    - Helps **prevent alert fatigue** by fine-tuning alert rules based on real error data.
- **Team Management**
    - Assigns **on-call engineers** based on error severity and system impact.
    - Helps determine if enough engineers are available to **respond to errors efficiently**.
