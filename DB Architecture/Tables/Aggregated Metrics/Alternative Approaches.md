# Alternative Approaches

Different approaches can **enhance performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency** based on the use case.

### **1. On-the-fly Aggregation Instead of Pre-Computed Values**

- **Why Consider It?** Reduces storage needs by avoiding redundant data.
- **Downside?** Slows down queries since metrics must be aggregated in real-time.
- **Optimized Approach?**
    - Use **materialized views** for frequently accessed aggregates.
    - Cache results using **Redis** for fast retrieval without redundant computation.
    - Partition **raw metrics** for parallel processing instead of full scans.

### **2. Using a Separate Data Warehouse (Snowflake, Redshift) for Historical Analysis**

- **Why Consider It?** Cloud-based **columnar storage** is optimized for analytical queries.
- **Downside?** Adds data latency due to ETL processing.
- **Optimized Approach?**
    - Store only **recently used aggregated data** in PostgreSQL.
    - Move older aggregated data to **data warehouses** for historical trend analysis.
    - Use **ETL pipelines (Airflow, dbt)** to automate batch data transfers.

### **3. Keeping Aggregated Data in a NoSQL Store (Cassandra, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)**

- **Why Consider It?** NoSQL databases scale better for **high-ingestion time-series data**.
- **Downside?** Loses **SQL capabilities** for complex joins.
- **Optimized Approach?**
    - Store **raw metrics** in a NoSQL time-series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).
    - Use **PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers (FDW)** to query NoSQL data alongside relational tables.
    - Archive historical aggregates to **long-term storage (S3, BigQuery)** for cost efficiency.

### **4. Hybrid Model: Combining Fast Caching with Batch Aggregation**

- **Why Consider It?** Balances **real-time insights with efficient storage**.
- **How?**
    - Store recent data in **PostgreSQL** with partitioning for quick lookups.
    - Use **Redis/Memcached** to cache recent aggregations for fast dashboard loads.
    - Perform batch ETL jobs to move historical data to **cold storage** (e.g., AWS Glacier).

### **Takeaways**

Each approach **trades off speed, storage, and cost-efficiency**. **The best solution depends on** whether the system prioritizes real-time querying, historical trend analysis, or cost optimization.
