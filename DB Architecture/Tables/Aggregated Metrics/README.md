# Aggregated Metrics

This table stores pre-processed, summarized performance data for each server over specific time intervals. It is designed to optimize **trend analysis, capacity planning, and system health monitoring** by reducing the need for expensive real-time queries on raw metrics.

### **Data Points (Columns) – Purpose, Thought Process, and Data Type**

- **`server_id` (UUID, Foreign Key)**
    - **Purpose**: Links aggregated metrics to a specific server.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Required to associate performance data with individual servers.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables efficient querying of summarized metrics per server, which is key for tracking server-specific trends.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID`, ensuring uniqueness and referential integrity across distributed systems, useful for large-scale infrastructures.
- **`region` (VARCHAR(20))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the geographical region of the server.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Important for comparing server performance across locations, useful for distributed systems with servers in multiple regions.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Critical for **cost analysis**, **latency assessment**, and **load balancing strategies**. For example, different regions might experience varying levels of load and network performance.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(20)`, as region names (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-2`) are fixed-length text and vary in size.
- **`hourly_avg_cpu_usage` (DECIMAL(5,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the average CPU utilization over an hour.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to monitor CPU usage over time without querying raw CPU data, which could be resource-intensive.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Essential for detecting sustained high CPU loads, which can indicate potential **scalability issues** or inefficient application performance.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(5,2)`, providing precise percentage calculations (e.g., 75.34%) to track CPU usage effectively.
- **`hourly_avg_memory_usage` (DECIMAL(5,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Tracks the average memory usage over an hour.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **early detection of memory leaks** or excessive memory consumption that could affect server performance.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Crucial for **capacity planning** and ensuring that memory resources are being used efficiently.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(5,2)`, providing precision in memory usage percentages while minimizing storage overhead.
- **`peak_network_usage` (BIGINT)**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the highest recorded network traffic during an hour.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to identify **traffic spikes** that might indicate **DDoS attacks** or unexpected surges in demand.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in **proactive bandwidth scaling** and allows teams to detect potential network bottlenecks before they lead to service disruptions.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `BIGINT`, as network traffic is often large and represented in bytes, making `BIGINT` the appropriate choice for handling large values.
- **`peak_disk_usage` (BIGINT)**
    - **Purpose**: Captures the highest disk I/O usage in an hour.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Necessary for identifying **disk bottlenecks** that could affect overall system performance.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in **provisioning storage optimally** and avoiding performance degradation caused by disk constraints.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `BIGINT`, as disk usage often results in large values, especially when tracking I/O operations over time.
- **`uptime_percentage` (DECIMAL(5,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the percentage of time the server was available within the given period.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for tracking **SLA compliance** and assessing the server's reliability from a customer satisfaction standpoint.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Important for ensuring compliance with uptime guarantees (e.g., 99.9% SLA) and helping identify patterns that could lead to unplanned outages.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(5,2)`, ensuring accurate percentage calculations that are easy to understand and track.
- **`total_requests` (BIGINT)**
    - **Purpose**: Captures the total number of requests (e.g., API calls, database queries) processed by the server within the time interval.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Adds insights into the server's workload, especially when correlating CPU and memory usage with the request volume.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in understanding how the server’s load correlates with incoming traffic, useful for **scalability assessments** and **load testing**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `BIGINT`, as it can handle large request volumes and provides flexibility for high-traffic systems.
- **`error_rate` (DECIMAL(5,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the percentage of failed requests (or errors) over the total requests processed during the time period.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Adds insight into the quality of service, correlating failures with other performance metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Critical for identifying server issues that lead to high error rates, which could be indicative of poor performance or configuration problems.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(5,2)`, to express the error rate as a percentage with high precision.
- **`average_response_time` (DECIMAL(5,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Records the average time taken for the server to respond to a request during the time period.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Essential for monitoring server performance from the user's perspective.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Useful for tracking **latency trends** and optimizing server performance to meet SLAs.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(5,2)`, ensuring precise calculation of response times.
