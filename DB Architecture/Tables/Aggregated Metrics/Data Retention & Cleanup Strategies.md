# Data Retention & Cleanup Strategies

As your **cloud infrastructure monitoring** scales, managing **data retention efficiently** is critical to maintaining **database performance, reducing storage costs, and ensuring regulatory compliance**. Below are **advanced data cleanup techniques** that balance **real-time analytics, historical reporting, and storage efficiency**.

---

### **1. Auto-Archiving Older Data to Cold Storage**

**Why It Matters?**

- Prevents the **main database from getting bloated**, improving **query performance**.
- **Cold storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a Data Lake)** is **cheaper** than keeping everything in a relational database.

**How It Works?**

- **Move old aggregated metrics to a data lake or object storage** after a defined period (e.g., **30 days**).
- **Use compressed columnar storage formats (Parquet, ORC)** to optimize query performance.

**Implementation:**

- **Export old data to S3 (PostgreSQL Example)**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    COPY (SELECT * FROM aggregated_metrics WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days')
    TO 's3://my-data-lake/aggregated_metrics_2024.parquet'
    WITH (FORMAT PARQUET);
    
    ```
    
- **Remove archived data from the database**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    DELETE FROM aggregated_metrics WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
    
    ```
    
- **Query archived data in Amazon Athena (SQL on S3)**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT server_id, AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage)
    FROM my_data_lake.aggregated_metrics_2024
    WHERE region = 'us-east-1'
    GROUP BY server_id;
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Database remains lightweight and responsive.**

âœ… **Cost-effective long-term storage for historical analysis.**

âœ… **Queries remain fast for recent data, while old data is still accessible.**

### **2. Partitioning for Efficient Cleanup**

**Why It Matters?**

- **Dropping an entire partition is much faster than deleting rows**.
- Makes it easy to **retain only recent data while archiving/deleting old records**.

**How It Works?**

- Instead of storing everything in a **single table**, partition **aggregated_metrics** by **month** or **region**.
- Simply **drop old partitions** instead of running expensive DELETE queries.

**Implementation (PostgreSQL Example)**

- **Create monthly partitions**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE TABLE aggregated_metrics_2025_02 PARTITION OF aggregated_metrics
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-02-01') TO ('2025-03-01');
    
    ```
    
- **Drop old partitions instead of deleting rows**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    ALTER TABLE aggregated_metrics DETACH PARTITION aggregated_metrics_2024_12;
    DROP TABLE aggregated_metrics_2024_12;
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Dropping partitions is nearly instant**, unlike row-by-row DELETEs.

âœ… **Keeps the table size small**, ensuring **fast queries**.

âœ… **Easy to automate data retention policies** without performance overhead.

### **3. Deleting Redundant Records to Free Up Space**

**Why It Matters?**

- Some records become **redundant over time**, especially in **aggregated metrics** where **only trends matter**.
- **Removing duplicate or unnecessary data** reduces **database size** and **query execution times**.

**How It Works?**

- **Identify and remove duplicate records** while ensuring historical accuracy.
- Use **deduplication strategies** based on **timestamps, server IDs, and metric types**.

**Implementation:**

- **Remove exact duplicates using `DISTINCT ON()`**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    DELETE FROM aggregated_metrics a
    WHERE ctid NOT IN (
        SELECT MIN(ctid)
        FROM aggregated_metrics
        GROUP BY server_id, timestamp, region
    );
    
    ```
    
- **Keep only daily summaries instead of hourly data after 30 days**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    INSERT INTO aggregated_metrics_daily (server_id, region, date, avg_cpu_usage, avg_memory_usage)
    SELECT server_id, region, DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp), AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage), AVG(hourly_avg_memory_usage)
    FROM aggregated_metrics
    WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY server_id, region, DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp);
    
    DELETE FROM aggregated_metrics WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Reduces unnecessary storage usage.**

âœ… **Improves query efficiency by working with fewer, summarized records.**

âœ… **Maintains accuracy while removing redundant data.**

### **4. Using Background Jobs for Automated Cleanup**

**Why It Matters?**

- Manually deleting or archiving data can **slow down operations**.
- **Scheduled jobs** (cron jobs, database event triggers, or background workers) **automate cleanup** without affecting performance.

**How It Works?**

- **Schedule periodic cleanup tasks** to **remove old, redundant, or duplicated records.**
- **Run cleanup during off-peak hours** to minimize impact on live queries.

**Implementation (PostgreSQL & pgAgent):**

- **Create a scheduled job for deleting old data**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_old_data()
    RETURNS void AS $$
    BEGIN
        DELETE FROM aggregated_metrics WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    
    SELECT cron.schedule('daily_cleanup', '0 3 * * *', 'SELECT cleanup_old_data();');
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Automates cleanup** without manual intervention.

âœ… **Runs at optimal times** to minimize database load.

âœ… **Keeps storage costs low** by removing unnecessary data.

---

### **5. Compression & Storage Optimization for Retained Data**

**Why It Matters?**

- Even after **deleting redundant data**, the remaining data **should be stored efficiently**.
- **Compression can significantly reduce storage costs** while keeping queries **fast**.

**How It Works?**

- Use **columnar storage** for historical aggregated data.
- Enable **Zstandard or TOAST compression** in PostgreSQL.

**Implementation:**

- **Enable compression on large text fields (TOAST in PostgreSQL)**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    ALTER TABLE aggregated_metrics ALTER COLUMN region SET STORAGE EXTERNAL;
    
    ```
    
- **Use Zstandard for table compression**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE TABLE aggregated_metrics_compressed
    (LIKE aggregated_metrics INCLUDING ALL)
    WITH (compression = 'zstd');
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Reduces disk space usage by 50-70%.**

âœ… **Speeds up query execution by reducing I/O operations.**
