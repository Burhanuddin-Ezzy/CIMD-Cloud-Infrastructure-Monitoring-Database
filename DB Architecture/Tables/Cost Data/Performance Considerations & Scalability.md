# Performance Considerations & Scalability

- **Indexes on `timestamp` and `server_id` Optimize Cost Trend Queries**
    - **Why?** Queries often filter by time (`timestamp`) or server (`server_id`), so indexing these columns speeds up lookups.
    - **How?**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_cost_timestamp ON cost_data(timestamp);
        CREATE INDEX idx_cost_server ON cost_data(server_id);
        
        ```
        
    - **Trade-off:** Indexing speeds up reads but increases storage usage and write overhead.
- **Partitioning by `region` Reduces Query Time for Global Cost Analysis**
    - **Why?** Organizations with multi-region cloud deployments often need cost insights per region.
    - **How?**
        - **PostgreSQL Example (Declarative Partitioning):**
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            CREATE TABLE cost_data (
                server_id UUID,
                region VARCHAR(20),
                timestamp TIMESTAMP,
                cost_per_hour DECIMAL(10,2),
                total_monthly_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
                team_allocation VARCHAR(50)
            ) PARTITION BY LIST (region);
            
            CREATE TABLE cost_data_us_east PARTITION OF cost_data FOR VALUES IN ('us-east-1');
            CREATE TABLE cost_data_eu_west PARTITION OF cost_data FOR VALUES IN ('eu-west-1');
            
            ```
            
    - **Trade-off:** Partitioning improves query performance but adds complexity in schema design and management.
- **Pre-Aggregated Cost Summaries Improve Reporting Performance**
    - **Why?** Instead of scanning raw cost records for every report, precomputing summaries speeds up dashboards and analytics.
    - **How?**
        - **Using Materialized Views:**
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_cost_summary AS
            SELECT region, team_allocation, SUM(total_monthly_cost) AS total_cost
            FROM cost_data
            GROUP BY region, team_allocation;
            
            ```
            
        - **Refreshing the View Periodically:**
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_cost_summary;
            
            ```
            
    - **Trade-off:** Materialized views reduce query time but need to be refreshed periodically, adding maintenance overhead.
- **Sharding by `server_id` for Distributed Cost Processing**
    - **Why?** For organizations managing **thousands of servers**, a single table may become a bottleneck.
    - **How?**
        - **Sharding distributes cost data across multiple database nodes**, ensuring scalability.
        - Example:
            - Servers with **UUID starting with A-M** go to **Shard 1**.
            - Servers with **UUID starting with N-Z** go to **Shard 2**.
    - **Trade-off:** Sharding improves horizontal scalability but complicates joins and data consistency.
- **Caching Frequent Cost Queries with Redis or Memcached**
    - **Why?** Some cost reports (e.g., **"Total Cost per Team"**) donâ€™t change frequently and can be cached for faster access.
    - **How?** Store results in **Redis** or **Memcached** and update them periodically.
        - Example: Cache query result in Redis
            
            ```python
            python
            CopyEdit
            import redis
            cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
            cache.set("team_cost_summary", query_result, ex=3600)  # Expires in 1 hour
            
            ```
            
    - **Trade-off:** Caching reduces database load but requires cache invalidation strategies to keep data fresh.
