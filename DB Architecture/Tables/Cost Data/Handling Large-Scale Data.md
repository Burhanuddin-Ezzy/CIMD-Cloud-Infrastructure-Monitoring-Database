# Handling Large-Scale Data

As cost tracking data grows over time, handling scalability and performance becomes critical. This section outlines strategies for **efficient storage, retrieval, and distribution** of cost data to prevent slow queries and system overloads.

### **1. Data Archiving for Old Cost Records**

- **Why?** Large tables slow down queries, even with indexing. Archiving older, less frequently accessed cost records improves database efficiency.
- **How?**
    - **Move historical cost data to an archive table**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE cost_data_archive (
            server_id UUID,
            region VARCHAR(20),
            timestamp TIMESTAMP,
            cost_per_hour DECIMAL(10,2),
            total_monthly_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
            team_allocation VARCHAR(50)
        ) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);
        
        ```
        
    - **Use a scheduled job to move old records** (e.g., costs older than 2 years):
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        INSERT INTO cost_data_archive
        SELECT * FROM cost_data WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';
        
        DELETE FROM cost_data WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';
        
        ```
        
    - **Performance Gains:**
        - Active cost data stays **lightweight**, improving query speed.
        - Reduces **index bloat** and **storage overhead**.
    - **Trade-off:** Older data must be queried separately, requiring **joins or UNION operations** when needed.

### **2. Sharding Based on Region**

- **Why?** Instead of storing all cost records in a single database, **sharding** distributes data across multiple servers. This prevents a single database from becoming a bottleneck.
- **How?**
    - **Shard data based on `region`** so that different database servers handle different regions:
        - **Example Partitioning Plan**
            - `cost_data_us`: Stores cost data for `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`
            - `cost_data_eu`: Stores cost data for `eu-west-1`, `eu-central-1`
            - `cost_data_ap`: Stores cost data for `ap-south-1`, `ap-northeast-2`
    - **Queries automatically route to the correct shard** using a proxy like **Citus (PostgreSQL extension) or Vitess**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE cost_data (
            server_id UUID,
            region VARCHAR(20),
            timestamp TIMESTAMP,
            cost_per_hour DECIMAL(10,2),
            total_monthly_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
            team_allocation VARCHAR(50)
        ) DISTRIBUTED BY (region);
        
        ```
        
    - **Performance Gains:**
        - Queries **only scan relevant shards** instead of the entire dataset.
        - Reduces **CPU and memory contention** on a single server.
    - **Trade-off:** Requires **shard-aware queries** and more **database management overhead**.

### **3. Partitioning by Time for Faster Queries**

- **Why?** Instead of scanning all cost records, partitioning speeds up queries by allowing PostgreSQL to **ignore irrelevant partitions**.
- **How?**
    - **Partition cost data by month**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE cost_data (
            server_id UUID,
            region VARCHAR(20),
            timestamp TIMESTAMP,
            cost_per_hour DECIMAL(10,2),
            total_monthly_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
            team_allocation VARCHAR(50)
        ) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);
        
        CREATE TABLE cost_data_2025_01 PARTITION OF cost_data
        FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-01-31');
        
        CREATE TABLE cost_data_2025_02 PARTITION OF cost_data
        FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-02-01') TO ('2025-02-28');
        
        ```
        
    - **Performance Gains:**
        - Queries on recent cost data **only scan the latest partition**, avoiding full table scans.
        - Old partitions can be **archived or dropped** to manage storage efficiently.
    - **Trade-off:** Partitioning requires **proper indexing** and **query structuring** to take advantage of it.

### **4. Using Columnar Storage for Analytical Queries**

- **Why?** Traditional row-based databases store all columns together. **Columnar storage** improves **cost analytics queries** because it **only loads relevant columns**.
- **How?**
    - Use **PostgreSQL’s `cstore_fdw` extension** or **Amazon Redshift** (which is columnar by default).
    - **Example**: Instead of scanning the entire table, a columnar store loads only `region`, `timestamp`, and `total_monthly_cost` for aggregation queries.
    - **Performance Gains:**
        - Reduces **I/O** when fetching **aggregated cost data**.
        - Works well with **BI dashboards and analytical workloads**.
    - **Trade-off:** Not ideal for **transactional workloads** where frequent inserts/updates are required.

### **5. Compression for Storage Optimization**

- **Why?** Cost data contains repetitive values (`region`, `team_allocation`). **Compression** reduces storage while keeping queries fast.
- **How?**
    - Enable **PostgreSQL’s TOAST compression**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        ALTER TABLE cost_data ALTER COLUMN total_monthly_cost SET STORAGE EXTERNAL;
        
        ```
        
    - Store **old cost data in compressed Parquet format** in a **data warehouse** (e.g., Amazon S3 + Athena, Google BigQuery).
    - **Performance Gains:**
        - Reduces **disk usage**, especially for historical data.
        - **Faster retrieval** for long-term cost analysis.
    - **Trade-off:** Compression works best for **cold storage**, not real-time transactions.
