# Application Logs

This table stores **detailed logs generated by applications running on monitored servers**. It provides granular insight into **application performance, error tracking, and debugging**, making it essential for DevOps, SRE (Site Reliability Engineering), and security teams.

### **Data Points (Columns) â€“ Purpose, Thought Process, and Data Type**

- **`log_id` (UUID, Primary Key)**
    - **Purpose**: Ensures each log entry is uniquely identifiable.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Required to efficiently track and reference individual logs.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables log correlation across different applications.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID`, ensuring uniqueness without relying on incremental IDs, which can cause race conditions in distributed systems.
    - **Use Case**: Used as a **unique reference** for debugging logs in large-scale environments.
- **`server_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to `servers`)**
    - **Purpose**: Links logs to the server where the application is running.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Helps in diagnosing **server-specific issues** affecting applications.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Crucial for **filtering logs by server** in large environments.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID`, keeping consistency with `server_metrics` and `aggregated_metrics` tables.
    - **Use Case**: Allows operators to quickly **identify failing servers** based on their logs.
- **`app_name` (VARCHAR(255))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the name of the application producing the log.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **multi-application environments** where multiple apps run on the same server.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in filtering logs per application, making it easier to troubleshoot specific services.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(255)`, since application names are textual and can vary in length.
    - **Use Case**: Developers use this field to **debug application-specific failures**.
- **`log_level` (ENUM('DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'))**
    - **Purpose**: Indicates the severity of the log message.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Logs have different levels, from **debugging information to critical errors**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps prioritize logs for **alerting and troubleshooting**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `ENUM`, ensuring predefined values that allow for **faster filtering and indexing**.
    - **Use Case**: Helps **prioritize error resolution** by focusing on `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` logs first.
- **`error_code` (VARCHAR(50), Nullable)**
    - **Purpose**: Stores a **structured error identifier** when applicable (e.g., HTTP status codes, database error codes).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Instead of searching full log messages, filtering by error code is faster.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps **categorize errors efficiently**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50)`, allowing flexibility for different error types (e.g., HTTP `500`, DB `23505`).
    - **Use Case**: Helps filter logs by specific error types for **faster debugging and alerting**.
- **`log_timestamp` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the exact time when the log entry was generated.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **time-series analysis** and **correlating logs with incidents**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables **chronological event tracing** to reconstruct system failures.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, ensuring accurate log timing across distributed systems.
    - **Use Case**: Used to **analyze logs across different time zones** without inconsistencies.
- **`trace_id` (UUID, Nullable)**
    - **Purpose**: Correlates logs across distributed systems (microservices, multi-server deployments).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **Distributed Tracing**, which is crucial for microservices debugging.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps **track a request across multiple services**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID`, ensuring compatibility with OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, etc.
    - **Use Case**: Used to **identify latency bottlenecks** in a multi-service request.
- **`span_id` (UUID, Nullable)**
    - **Purpose**: Identifies a single operation within a distributed trace.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Helps track execution time of specific operations.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Essential for **profiling performance bottlenecks**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID`, ensuring consistency with tracing tools.
    - **Use Case**: Used to **pinpoint slow database queries or API calls**
- **`source_ip` (INET, Nullable)**
    - **Purpose**: Captures the originating IP address.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **security monitoring and geo-analysis**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps **trace attacks and identify latency issues**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `INET`, optimized for IP storage in PostgreSQL.
    - **Use Case**: Used for **blocking malicious IPs** or analyzing request origins.
- **`user_id` (UUID, Nullable, Foreign Key to `users`)**
    - **Purpose**: Links logs to authenticated users when applicable.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **audit trails and forensic analysis**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Crucial for **tracking suspicious user activity**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID`, keeping consistency across tables.
    - **Use Case**: Used to **trace unauthorized actions** performed by a specific user.
- **`log_source` (ENUM('APP', 'DATABASE', 'SECURITY', 'SYSTEM'))**
    - **Purpose**: Categorizes logs by their origin.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Helps in **log filtering and prioritization**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Speeds up **incident response workflows**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `ENUM`, ensuring **fast filtering**.
    - **Use Case**: Allows **separating security logs from application logs**.
