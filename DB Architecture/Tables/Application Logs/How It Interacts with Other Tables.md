# How It Interacts with Other Tables

- **Joins with `server_metrics`** to correlate logs with server performance issues.
    - Logs can indicate issues related to CPU, memory, or disk usage. By joining with `server_metrics`, you can link application-specific errors to resource constraints. This allows for **root cause analysis** by identifying whether performance issues are triggered by server resource exhaustion.
- **Joins with `error_logs`** to identify application-related failures.
    - `application_logs` can capture all logs, including warnings or informational messages. By joining with `error_logs`, you can specifically isolate and analyze **critical application failures** to **track bug patterns** and determine whether these failures are frequent or related to specific system events.
- **Joins with `alert_history`** to trigger alerts based on log severity levels.
    - When a log is generated with a **critical error** or a **warning**, joining it with `alert_history` helps to check if similar alerts have been triggered in the past. This enables automatic escalation or **alerting teams about recurring issues** that need urgent attention. The severity level of logs can also be used to determine the type of alert (e.g., critical errors trigger immediate alerts).
- **Joins with `downtime_logs`** to correlate application failures with server downtimes.
    - Application failures might be exacerbated during downtimes or server restarts. By joining with `downtime_logs`, you can track if **application errors correlate with server outages**, helping to distinguish whether errors are related to **server availability** or to other underlying issues within the application itself.
- **Joins with `resource_allocation`** to analyze resource consumption trends during application failures.
    - When logs indicate errors, particularly performance-related issues, joining with `resource_allocation` allows you to track **resource allocation patterns** during periods of high error rates, ensuring that resources are being efficiently utilized and helping to plan for future scaling or resource adjustments.
- **Joins with `cost_data`** to assess if application issues are contributing to cost spikes.
    - In large environments, poor application performance or errors might cause additional resource consumption, which in turn can drive up cloud service costs. By joining logs with `cost_data`, you can see if specific application errors are leading to **unnecessary cost spikes**, helping optimize cloud infrastructure and budgeting strategies.
- **Joins with `aggregated_metrics`** to correlate application log trends with system-level performance.
    - By correlating logs with aggregated metrics (like CPU, memory, and network usage), you can analyze if specific application errors align with **resource strain**. For instance, if high CPU usage corresponds with increased application errors, it can highlight potential **bottlenecks** in the application’s architecture.
- **Joins with `user_access_logs`** to trace errors back to specific users or user activities.
    - If logs indicate errors related to user requests, joining with `user_access_logs` helps trace errors to specific users, their actions, or even potential misuse. This is particularly useful for **security analysis** and **understanding application flow**.
- **Joins with `alerts_configuration`** to customize log-based alerting thresholds.
    - By joining with the `alerts_configuration` table, you can tailor the alerts based on the type of log entry (e.g., trigger alerts only for certain error types, like "CRITICAL" or "ERROR"). This allows you to create **fine-tuned alerting systems** based on the **severity and frequency** of specific log entries.
- **Joins with `team_management`** to assign logs or alerts to the appropriate teams.
    - By associating logs with the teams responsible for specific areas of the application (e.g., frontend team, backend team, database team), you can streamline the **incident response process** and **assign tickets** based on log patterns. This ensures that the right team is alerted and can take action swiftly.
- **Joins with `incident_response_logs`** to track the resolution of application-related incidents.
    - When application errors trigger incidents, joining with `incident_response_logs` helps track the progress of incident resolution. It provides a full audit trail of the **response and resolution** process, ensuring that any errors or failures are properly addressed and documented for future learning.

### **Use Case Example**:

Let’s imagine you’re investigating a **performance issue** on a web application:

1. You can **join `application_logs` with `server_metrics`** to see if **high CPU or memory usage** corresponds with the time period where performance errors are logged.
2. **Joining with `error_logs`** will allow you to examine whether the performance problems are linked to a specific application error, like a timeout or database connection failure.
3. **Alert history joins** could show if these issues have triggered alerts in the past and if they are recurring, signaling a deeper, unresolved issue.
4. Finally, by joining with **`cost_data`**, you can analyze if these performance issues are also causing higher-than-expected infrastructure costs, leading you to **optimize resource allocation** for both performance and cost efficiency.

By joining `application_logs` with these tables, you gain a **holistic view** of application performance, enabling faster detection, investigation, and resolution of system issues.
