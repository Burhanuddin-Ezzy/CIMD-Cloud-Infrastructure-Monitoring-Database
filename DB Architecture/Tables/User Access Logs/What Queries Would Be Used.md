# What Queries Would Be Used?

1. **Find all access events by a specific user:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT * FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE user_id = 'usr123';
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query retrieves all access logs for a specific user. It is useful for auditing purposes, where administrators can trace a user's actions across multiple servers and applications.
2. **Find access events for a specific server:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT * FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE server_id = 'srv456';
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query focuses on all access events to a specific server. It helps system admins monitor and analyze which users are interacting with the server, useful for detecting unusual patterns of access.
3. **Find IP addresses accessing a server during a specific time period:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT access_ip, COUNT(*)
    FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE server_id = 'srv123'
    AND timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-31 12:00:00' AND '2024-01-31 14:00:00'
    GROUP BY access_ip;
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query provides an aggregated view of how many times different IP addresses accessed the server during a given timeframe. It's useful for identifying potential attacks like brute force or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) based on repeated access from certain IPs.
4. **Find all users who accessed the system outside of regular working hours:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE timestamp NOT BETWEEN '2024-01-01 09:00:00' AND '2024-01-01 18:00:00'
    GROUP BY user_id;
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query identifies users accessing the system outside normal business hours, which could flag suspicious behavior for further investigation. It helps detect unauthorized access or unusual user activity.
5. **Find all failed access attempts (e.g., if an access type is 'WRITE' but fails due to permission issues):**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT * FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE access_type = 'WRITE'
    AND access_status = 'FAILED';
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query identifies users who tried to perform write actions but failed, which could indicate attempts to modify data without proper authorization. It helps with security monitoring by detecting potential breaches or misconfigurations.
6. **Find all access events from a specific IP address:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT * FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE access_ip = '192.168.1.1';
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query helps track all actions made from a given IP address, which is useful in identifying suspicious or repeated behavior originating from a particular source, such as an attacker’s IP address.
7. **Find the number of access events for each access type (READ, WRITE, DELETE, EXECUTE):**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT access_type, COUNT(*)
    FROM user_access_logs
    GROUP BY access_type
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query provides a breakdown of access events by type, helping system administrators understand what kinds of operations are being performed most often. It is useful for analyzing user behavior and identifying potential misuse of privileges.
8. **Find users who accessed sensitive data during a specific period:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE access_type = 'READ'
    AND server_id IN ('srv123', 'srv456') -- assuming these are servers hosting sensitive data
    AND timestamp BETWEEN '2024-02-01 00:00:00' AND '2024-02-02 23:59:59'
    GROUP BY user_id;
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query tracks users who accessed sensitive servers within a given period. It’s crucial for identifying which users may have accessed private or sensitive data and for ensuring compliance with data protection policies.
9. **Find the most common servers accessed by users:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT server_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM user_access_logs
    GROUP BY server_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query aggregates access events by server, helping to identify which servers are most frequently accessed. It can indicate which servers require more attention or security measures due to their popularity among users.
10. **Detect multiple failed login attempts by a user (potential brute force):**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM user_access_logs
    WHERE access_type = 'EXECUTE'
    AND access_status = 'FAILED'
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;  -- Threshold of 5 failed attempts
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case**: This query helps detect potential brute force attacks by tracking users who have multiple failed login attempts, alerting the system for further security measures.

### Summary:

These additional queries allow you to dive deeper into user access patterns, security events, and audit trails. They are designed to help monitor user behavior, ensure compliance, detect anomalies, and optimize performance by analyzing the frequency and type of user interactions with your system. These queries, in combination with the existing ones, would offer a comprehensive toolset for managing and auditing user access across a distributed environment.
