# Alerting & Automation

1. **Real-Time Alerts for Unusual Login Attempts**:
    - **Purpose**: To detect and respond to suspicious activities such as brute force attacks, unauthorized login attempts, or account compromises.
    - **Why This Is Important**: Real-time alerting helps to quickly identify and mitigate security risks, preventing potential breaches before they escalate.
    - **How to Implement**:
        - **Multiple Failed Login Attempts**: Set up alerts to trigger when a user or IP address experiences multiple failed login attempts within a short time window (e.g., 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes).
        - **Login Attempts from Unfamiliar IPs**: Create alerts for logins from new or uncommon IP addresses, especially if those addresses are outside the userâ€™s usual geographical region.
        - **Example**: Alerting for failed logins from an unusual IP:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT user_id, access_ip, COUNT(*) AS failed_attempts
        FROM user_access_logs
        WHERE access_type = 'LOGIN' AND timestamp > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
        GROUP BY user_id, access_ip
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
        
        ```
        
        - **Notification Mechanism**: Configure real-time notifications using monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus with Alertmanager, or Splunk) to send alerts via email, SMS, or integrate with incident management systems like PagerDuty or ServiceNow.
2. **Automated Alerts for Accessing Sensitive Data**:
    - **Purpose**: To trigger alerts when users access sensitive data or perform actions beyond their normal access levels.
    - **Why This Is Important**: Detecting unusual access to sensitive or high-risk systems (e.g., admin access to production servers, access to customer PII) can help mitigate the risks of data leaks or unauthorized modifications.
    - **How to Implement**:
        - **Sensitive Data Access**: Set up alerts when users access files, databases, or servers marked as sensitive or confidential.
        - **Elevation of Privileges**: Trigger alerts if users perform actions that require elevated privileges (e.g., delete, write, or execute commands on critical systems).
        - **Example**: Triggering alerts for sensitive data access:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT user_id, server_id, access_type, timestamp
        FROM user_access_logs
        WHERE access_type IN ('DELETE', 'WRITE')
        AND server_id IN (SELECT server_id FROM servers WHERE sensitive = TRUE)
        AND timestamp > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour';
        
        ```
        
        - **Notification Mechanism**: Integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems to send automatic alerts when access patterns violate predefined policies.
3. **Automated Reporting for Compliance Audits**:
    - **Purpose**: To streamline compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by automating the generation of access log reports.
    - **Why This Is Important**: Automating access log reporting ensures that audits are completed on time and reduces the risk of human error. It also helps maintain a clear audit trail for regulatory inspections.
    - **How to Implement**:
        - **Scheduled Reports**: Set up scheduled queries to generate periodic reports on user access to sensitive systems or compliance-related logs.
        - **Quarterly Compliance Reports**: Automate the generation of reports that track user access over a set period, highlighting any anomalies or compliance violations.
        - **Example**: Generating quarterly reports of sensitive data access:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS sensitive_access_count, MIN(timestamp) AS first_access, MAX(timestamp) AS last_access
        FROM user_access_logs
        WHERE server_id IN (SELECT server_id FROM servers WHERE sensitive = TRUE)
        AND timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31'
        GROUP BY user_id;
        
        ```
        
        - **Notification Mechanism**: Use reporting tools (e.g., Crystal Reports, Microsoft Power BI, or custom scripts) to generate and email reports to relevant stakeholders (e.g., security officers, compliance teams) on a regular basis.
        - **Integration with Compliance Platforms**: Integrate the reporting system with compliance platforms to track access against regulatory benchmarks and ensure transparency during audits.
4. **Automated Block of Suspicious IPs**:
    - **Purpose**: To protect your systems automatically from suspicious IP addresses that exhibit malicious behavior (e.g., multiple failed logins, access attempts from blacklisted IPs).
    - **Why This Is Important**: Automatically blocking malicious IPs reduces the time and manual effort required to stop potential threats, especially during active attacks.
    - **How to Implement**:
        - **Suspicious IP Detection**: Trigger an alert and block IPs exhibiting abnormal behavior, such as multiple failed login attempts or accessing from geographies that are not relevant for your users.
        - **Blacklist Integration**: Use existing IP blacklists (e.g., AbuseIPDB, ipinfo.io) or integrate with threat intelligence platforms to automate blocking known malicious IPs.
        - **Example**: Automatically blocking IP after multiple failed login attempts:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT access_ip, COUNT(*) AS failed_attempts
        FROM user_access_logs
        WHERE access_type = 'LOGIN' AND timestamp > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour'
        GROUP BY access_ip
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
        -- Use the resulting IPs for blocking via firewall rules or automated scripts.
        
        ```
        
        - **Firewall Integration**: Use firewall management systems to automatically block IP addresses or integrate with automated security scripts that update firewall rules in real time.
5. **Automated Ticket Generation for Security Incidents**:
    - **Purpose**: To automatically generate incident response tickets when suspicious access patterns are detected, streamlining the incident management process.
    - **Why This Is Important**: Automated ticket creation ensures a faster response time to potential security incidents and reduces manual intervention in urgent situations.
    - **How to Implement**:
        - **Incident Detection**: Configure alerts for high-priority events, such as unauthorized access to critical systems, which automatically trigger the creation of incident tickets in your incident management system.
        - **Integration with Incident Management**: Integrate with platforms like Jira, ServiceNow, or PagerDuty to automatically create tickets based on specific alerts.
        - **Example**: Automated ticket creation for critical security incidents:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT user_id, access_ip, server_id, access_type, timestamp
        FROM user_access_logs
        WHERE access_type = 'DELETE' AND timestamp > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour';
        -- Trigger an incident ticket creation in Jira/ServiceNow based on this query.
        
        ```
        
6. **Daily Summary of Critical Access Logs**:
    - **Purpose**: To generate a daily summary report that highlights critical access logs for further investigation by security teams.
    - **Why This Is Important**: Having a daily summary ensures that the security team is aware of potential risks, even in cases where no real-time alerting mechanism was triggered.
    - **How to Implement**:
        - **Daily Log Summaries**: Create daily reports summarizing failed logins, critical access attempts, and any alerts raised during the day.
        - **Example**: Summarizing failed logins and sensitive data access:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS failed_logins
        FROM user_access_logs
        WHERE access_type = 'LOGIN'
        AND timestamp > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
        GROUP BY user_id;
        
        ```
        
        - **Email Notifications**: Automate the email distribution of daily summaries to security teams and key stakeholders.

By implementing these alerting and automation strategies, organizations can enhance their ability to detect, respond to, and report security incidents. These measures improve operational efficiency and reduce the risk of delayed responses to security threats.
