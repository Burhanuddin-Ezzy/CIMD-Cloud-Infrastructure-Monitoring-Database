# Alerts Configuration

This table stores **configurable alert settings** for monitoring server metrics. It enables administrators to set thresholds for different metrics, define notification rules, and customize alert frequency. This ensures **proactive monitoring** and **rapid response to issues** like high CPU usage or memory exhaustion.

### **Data Points (Columns) â€“ Purpose, Thought Process, and Data Type**

- **`alert_config_id` (UUID, Primary Key)**
    - **Purpose**: Uniquely identifies each alert configuration.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to differentiate between multiple alert configurations for different servers and metrics.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Ensures that each alert configuration is uniquely identifiable and can be referenced when updating or modifying rules.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` is used for uniqueness and scalability across a distributed environment.
- **`server_id` (UUID, Foreign Key)**
    - **Purpose**: Links the alert configuration to a specific server.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to associate alerts with specific servers, allowing customized monitoring.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps track which servers have specific alerts configured and allows for filtering alerts by server.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` ensures consistency and referential integrity with the `server_metrics` table.
- **`metric_name` (VARCHAR(50))**
    - **Purpose**: Specifies the metric to monitor (e.g., `CPU usage`, `Memory usage`).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Allows flexibility to monitor different performance and infrastructure metrics.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables dynamic monitoring where different thresholds can be set for different types of server performance indicators.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50)` to support various metric names without excessive storage overhead.
- **`threshold_value` (FLOAT)**
    - **Purpose**: Defines the value at which an alert should be triggered.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to specify the exact limit that, when breached, requires action.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Allows admins to set fine-grained alert thresholds (e.g., alert when CPU usage exceeds `80%`).
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `FLOAT` because thresholds require decimal precision (e.g., `CPU > 85.5%`).
- **`alert_frequency` (INTERVAL or VARCHAR(20))**
    - **Purpose**: Specifies how often the alert should be triggered (e.g., every `5 minutes`).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Required to prevent excessive alerting (e.g., avoiding alert floods every second for a minor CPU spike).
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Ensures controlled notifications by setting intervals to avoid redundant alerts.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `INTERVAL` (for databases that support it) or `VARCHAR(20)` (for flexibility) to store values like `5 minutes`, `30 minutes`.
- **`contact_email` (VARCHAR(255))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the email of the person/team to notify when the alert is triggered.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to route alerts to the right person/team for action.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Ensures that alerts reach the right responders quickly.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(255)` to store email addresses in a standard format
- **`alert_enabled` (BOOLEAN)**
    - **Purpose**: Indicates whether the alert is active or disabled.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Useful for temporarily disabling certain alerts without having to delete the configuration.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Provides flexibility in managing alerts, allowing administrators to disable alerts for maintenance or troubleshooting without losing configuration settings.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `BOOLEAN` to store the active status of the alert configuration. This ensures clarity in enabling or disabling alerts and is easy to query.
- **`alert_type` (ENUM('EMAIL', 'SMS', 'WEBHOOK', 'SLACK'))**
    - **Purpose**: Specifies the type of notification for the alert (e.g., `Email`, `SMS`, `Webhook`, `Slack`).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to enable different alerting mechanisms based on team preferences and availability of communication channels.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Multiple notification types ensure flexibility in alerting, allowing organizations to respond to issues in the way that's most effective for them.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `ENUM` for predefined notification types, ensuring only valid types are used and improving query efficiency.
- **`severity_level` (ENUM('LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH', 'CRITICAL'))**
    - **Purpose**: Specifies the severity of the alert, helping prioritize actions.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Allows categorization of alerts by their importance, helping teams to respond appropriately.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Critical for incident prioritization and managing response efforts. Alerts with different severity levels may have different notification strategies (e.g., critical alerts sent immediately, lower severity alerts batched).
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `ENUM` ensures predefined severity levels, improving clarity and reducing the chances of incorrect severity assignments.
