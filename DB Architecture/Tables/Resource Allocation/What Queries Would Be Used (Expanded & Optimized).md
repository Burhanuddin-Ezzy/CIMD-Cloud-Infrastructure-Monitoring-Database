# What Queries Would Be Used? (Expanded & Optimized)

To make better use of the **Resource Allocation** table, here are various queries categorized by **performance analysis, cost optimization, scaling decisions, and troubleshooting.**

## **Performance & Capacity Planning Queries**

### **Find Servers Exceeding a Memory Allocation Threshold**

Identifies over-allocated servers that may need resizing.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT server_id, allocated_memory FROM resource_allocation WHERE allocated_memory > 16000;

```

This helps detect high-memory servers that may be over-provisioned or underutilized.

### **Check CPU Allocation for Database Workloads**

Lists CPU allocations for database servers to ensure proper provisioning.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT server_id, allocated_cpu FROM resource_allocation WHERE workload_type = 'Database';

```

Ensures database servers have sufficient CPU for queries and transactions.

### **Identify Underutilized Memory Resources**

Finds servers where less than 50% of allocated memory is actually used.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.allocated_memory, sm.memory_usage FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN server_metrics sm ON ra.server_id = sm.server_id WHERE sm.memory_usage < (ra.allocated_memory * 0.5);

```

Helps with right-sizing resources by reclaiming unused memory for other workloads.

### **Identify Servers Running at Maximum Capacity**

Detects overburdened servers that may need scaling.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.allocated_cpu, sm.cpu_usage FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN server_metrics sm ON ra.server_id = sm.server_id WHERE sm.cpu_usage > (ra.allocated_cpu * 0.9);

```

Triggers autoscaling or server upgrades before performance degrades.

### **Detect Disk Space Bottlenecks**

Finds servers where disk usage exceeds 80% of allocated storage.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.allocated_disk_space, sm.disk_usage FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN server_metrics sm ON ra.server_id = sm.server_id WHERE sm.disk_usage > (ra.allocated_disk_space * 0.8);

```

Prevents system crashes caused by insufficient storage.

## **Cost Optimization Queries**

### **Find High-Cost Resource Allocations by Application**

Identifies applications with expensive resource allocations.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ad.app_name, ra.server_id, ra.allocated_memory, ra.allocated_cpu, ra.cost_per_hour FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN app_deployments ad ON ra.app_id = ad.app_id ORDER BY ra.cost_per_hour DESC LIMIT 10;

```

Helps reduce cloud costs by optimizing expensive workloads.

### **Compare Allocated vs. Billed Resource Costs**

Detects billing discrepancies for allocated resources.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.app_id, ra.allocated_memory, ra.allocated_cpu, ra.cost_per_hour, bd.total_billed FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN billing_data bd ON ra.server_id = bd.server_id WHERE bd.billing_period = '2025-02';

```

Ensures billing transparency and avoids unnecessary expenses.

### **Detect Unused Servers Still Being Billed**

Finds servers with allocated resources but no active workloads.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.allocated_memory, ra.allocated_cpu FROM resource_allocation ra LEFT JOIN app_deployments ad ON ra.app_id = ad.app_id WHERE ad.app_id IS NULL;

```

Identifies idle servers that can be decommissioned to save costs.

## **Autoscaling & Optimization Queries**

### **Find Applications That Should Be Autoscaled**

Lists applications with high utilization but no autoscaling enabled.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.app_id, ra.allocated_memory, ra.utilization_percentage FROM resource_allocation ra WHERE ra.utilization_percentage > 85 AND ra.autoscaling_enabled = FALSE;

```

Prevents performance drops by enabling autoscaling on resource-heavy applications.

### **Suggest Scaling Actions Based on Utilization**

Determines if scaling up or down is needed.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.allocated_memory, sm.memory_usage, CASE WHEN sm.memory_usage > (ra.allocated_memory * 0.9) THEN 'Scale Up' WHEN sm.memory_usage < (ra.allocated_memory * 0.3) THEN 'Scale Down' ELSE 'No Change' END AS scaling_decision FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN server_metrics sm ON ra.server_id = sm.server_id;

```

Automates scaling decisions for dynamic infrastructure management.

## **Troubleshooting & Incident Management Queries**

### **Find Servers That Recently Crashed Due to Resource Issues**

Identifies servers that suffered an incident due to low resources.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, ra.allocated_memory, il.issue_description, il.timestamp FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN incident_logs il ON ra.server_id = il.server_id WHERE il.issue_type IN ('Out of Memory', 'High CPU Usage', 'Disk Full') ORDER BY il.timestamp DESC;

```

Speeds up root cause analysis for server failures.

### **Identify Servers with Frequent Resource-Related Incidents**

Detects which servers have recurring resource-related failures.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT ra.server_id, COUNT(il.issue_id) AS incident_count FROM resource_allocation ra JOIN incident_logs il ON ra.server_id = il.server_id WHERE il.issue_type IN ('Out of Memory', 'High CPU Usage', 'Disk Full') GROUP BY ra.server_id ORDER BY incident_count DESC LIMIT 10;

```

Flags problematic servers that may need reconfiguration or upgrades.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Performance Optimization:** Prevent over- and under-provisioning with `server_metrics`.
- **Cost Reduction:** Identify expensive, underutilized, or idle resources.
- **Autoscaling Decisions:** Enable scaling only where necessary.
- **Incident Prevention:** Quickly detect and fix resource-related outages.
