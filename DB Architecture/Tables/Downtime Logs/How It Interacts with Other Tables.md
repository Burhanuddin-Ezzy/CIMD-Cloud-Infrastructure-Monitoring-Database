# How It Interacts with Other Tables

The **downtime logs** table plays a crucial role in **root cause analysis** and **incident response** by integrating with key tables across the system. By correlating downtime events with server performance metrics, error logs, and incident management workflows, it provides a **holistic view** of system failures and their impact.

### **1. Correlation with `server_metrics` for Performance Analysis**

- Links downtime events with **CPU, memory, and disk utilization** to determine if resource exhaustion contributed to failures.
- Helps identify patterns such as **high CPU spikes preceding downtime**, indicating potential overload issues.

### **Query: Identify Downtime Events with High CPU Usage Before Failure**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT d.downtime_id, d.server_id, d.start_time, d.end_time, s.cpu_usage, s.memory_usage
FROM downtime_logs d
JOIN server_metrics s
ON d.server_id = s.server_id
AND s.timestamp BETWEEN d.start_time - INTERVAL '10 minutes' AND d.start_time
WHERE s.cpu_usage > 90 OR s.memory_usage > 90;

```

### **2. Integration with `error_logs` for Incident Diagnostics**

- Associates downtime events with preceding **critical errors** to pinpoint software or hardware failures.
- Helps determine if repeated application errors are leading to service disruptions.
- Useful for **predictive failure analysis**, allowing proactive issue resolution.

### **Query: Check If a Downtime Event Was Preceded by Critical Errors**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT d.downtime_id, d.server_id, e.error_message, e.timestamp, e.error_severity
FROM downtime_logs d
JOIN error_logs e
ON d.server_id = e.server_id
AND e.timestamp BETWEEN d.start_time - INTERVAL '30 minutes' AND d.start_time
WHERE e.error_severity = 'CRITICAL';

```

---

### **3. Connection to `incident_management` for Tracking Resolutions**

- Links downtime events to **incident tickets**, ensuring structured investigation and resolution tracking.
- Helps evaluate **response times**, **root cause resolutions**, and **SLA compliance** for system outages.
- Provides visibility into whether a downtime event was **resolved, in progress, or escalated**.

### **Query: Retrieve Open Incidents Related to Downtime Events**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT d.downtime_id, d.server_id, i.ticket_id, i.status, i.assigned_to, i.resolution_notes
FROM downtime_logs d
JOIN incident_management i
ON d.downtime_id = i.downtime_id
WHERE i.status IN ('Open', 'In Progress');

```

---

### **4. Dependency on `alerts_configuration` for Downtime Notifications**

- Uses pre-configured alert rules to **trigger notifications** when a downtime event is detected.
- Ensures immediate escalation to **on-call engineers** via **email, Slack, PagerDuty, or SMS**.
- Helps define conditions for **automatic service recovery** or restart attempts.

### **Query: Fetch Alert Recipients for a Downtime Event**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT d.downtime_id, a.notification_channel, a.recipient_email, a.alert_threshold
FROM downtime_logs d
JOIN alerts_configuration a
ON d.server_id = a.server_id
WHERE a.alert_type = 'DOWNTIME' AND d.end_time IS NULL;

```

---

### **5. Relationship with `cost_data` for Financial Impact Assessment**

- Links downtime incidents with **estimated financial loss** due to service unavailability.
- Helps determine the **cost per hour of downtime**, assisting in **capacity planning and SLA negotiations**.
- Provides insights into which failures result in the highest **business impact**.

### **Query: Estimate Downtime Cost for Each Incident**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT d.downtime_id, d.server_id, c.cost_per_hour,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (d.end_time - d.start_time)) / 3600 * c.cost_per_hour AS estimated_loss
FROM downtime_logs d
JOIN cost_data c
ON d.server_id = c.server_id;

```

### **Summary of Interactions**

âœ… **`server_metrics`** â†’ Analyzes resource spikes before downtime.

âœ… **`error_logs`** â†’ Identifies critical errors leading to outages.

âœ… **`incident_management`** â†’ Tracks incident resolution and SLA compliance.

âœ… **`alerts_configuration`** â†’ Automates downtime notifications and responses.

âœ… **`cost_data`** â†’ Assesses financial impact of downtime events.

By integrating these tables, the system enables **proactive monitoring, rapid incident resolution, and strategic decision-making** for cloud infrastructure reliability. ðŸš€
