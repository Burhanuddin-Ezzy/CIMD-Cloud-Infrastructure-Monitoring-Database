# Thought Process Behind Decisions

Several key considerations guided the architecture and design choices for the downtime logs table to ensure it meets both current operational needs and future scalability:

**Relational Storage for Structured Reporting and Joinability**:
Relational databases were chosen for the downtime logs to leverage their structured nature, ensuring that downtime data is easy to query, analyze, and join with other tables. This approach allows for complex queries and reporting on downtime events, including joining with `server_metrics` for performance analysis and with `incident_management` to track tickets. Relational storage offers the flexibility of using SQL for querying, which is ideal for reporting, aggregations, and enforcing referential integrity between tables.

**Schema Optimized for Quick Retrieval of Downtime Patterns**:
The schema was designed to optimize the performance of queries that identify downtime patterns, such as those related to server reliability or SLA violations. For instance, columns like `server_id`, `start_time`, and `sla_tracking` were indexed to allow fast lookups for frequently used queries. Partitioning the downtime logs by date (e.g., monthly) further helps reduce query time by limiting the amount of data scanned during retrieval, ensuring efficient analysis even as the data grows.

Additionally, **aggregated views** were created to allow for faster reporting on total downtime per server, downtime per day, or SLA violations. These materialized views provide pre-aggregated data, speeding up retrieval time for commonly accessed reports.

**Scalability Concerns Addressed by Archiving Historical Data**:
To ensure the system can scale as the volume of downtime logs grows over time, older data is archived to cold storage (e.g., S3, Glacier). This archival process minimizes the strain on the primary database, reducing the cost and complexity of storing and querying massive datasets while still maintaining easy access to historical data if needed for compliance or long-term analysis.

In addition to archival strategies, **data retention policies** were put in place to ensure logs are removed when they are no longer required, such as deleting records older than two years after SLA audit periods. This helps prevent the table from growing too large and slows the eventual need for database scaling.

**Data Integrity and Accuracy**:
Enforcing strong data integrity through **foreign key constraints** and **check constraints** ensures that the downtime logs are valid and reliable. By enforcing rules such as ensuring the `end_time` is after the `start_time` and associating downtime records with existing server data, we eliminate the potential for inconsistent or incorrect downtime records. Automated tests validate that downtime calculations are correct, which provides confidence in the accuracy of the logs.

**User Access Control**:
Since downtime logs contain critical operational data, we implemented **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict access to sensitive information. Developers can view downtime logs, but only authorized personnel (admins) can modify records, particularly the resolution status of downtime events. This maintains a clear audit trail of who is responsible for resolving downtime and prevents accidental data manipulation.

**Optimized Querying for Performance**:
To ensure quick retrieval of downtime data, particularly for high-frequency use cases like monitoring server uptime or SLA compliance, the schema includes optimized indexes on commonly queried columns (such as `server_id` and `start_time`). Queries to identify SLA violations or downtime duration are streamlined through the use of these indexes, ensuring that users can retrieve downtime logs quickly without overwhelming the database.

By making decisions based on the needs for performance, scalability, data integrity, and security, the design of the downtime logs system is both robust and adaptable to growing data volumes while supporting real-time monitoring, reporting, and SLA compliance efforts. The choice of relational storage, indexing, and archiving reflects a balanced approach to handling large-scale data while ensuring the system remains efficient and easy to maintain.
