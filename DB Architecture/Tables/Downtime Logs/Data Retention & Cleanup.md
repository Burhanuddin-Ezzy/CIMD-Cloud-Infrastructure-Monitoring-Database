# Data Retention & Cleanup

An effective **data retention policy** ensures that only relevant and necessary data is kept in the database, helping to optimize storage, maintain compliance, and improve query performance.

**Data Retention Policy:**

A typical retention policy for downtime logs could specify that records are retained for the **SLA audit period** (e.g., 2 years) to meet compliance requirements and provide historical insights into server uptime, SLA violations, and incident management. After the audit period, logs are either archived to cold storage or deleted to free up space in the database. This ensures that the database remains performant by preventing excessive growth and maintaining the focus on recent, actionable data.

For example, logs older than two years can be deleted, or moved to an archival system:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
DELETE FROM downtime_logs WHERE start_time < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

```

Alternatively, they could be moved to a cold storage solution (such as Amazon S3 or Glacier) and indexed for retrieval without impacting the primary database:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
aws s3 cp downtime_logs-archive.tar.gz s3://my-archive-bucket/ --storage-class GLACIER

```

**Automated Cleanup Scripts:**

To streamline data management and ensure compliance, **automated cleanup scripts** can be implemented. These scripts can run on a scheduled basis (e.g., nightly or weekly) to delete outdated logs, move them to cold storage, or mark them for purging once the retention period has expired. Automation ensures that these tasks are consistently performed without manual intervention, reducing the risk of human error.

These scripts should perform actions like:

1. **Removing expired records:** Delete downtime logs older than the retention period.
2. **Archiving older logs:** If required for compliance, older logs should be moved to cold storage solutions such as **Amazon S3**, **Azure Blob Storage**, or **Google Cloud Storage**.
3. **Compressing data:** Logs in the database may be compressed before being moved to cold storage to reduce the storage costs.
4. **Managing indexing and performance:** Once logs are deleted or archived, relevant indexes and database partitions can be updated to ensure fast access to current data and prevent performance degradation.

For example, a cleanup script could be scheduled with a cron job on a Linux system:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
# Cron job for automated cleanup
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/cleanup_script.py

```

In the script, you could implement logic for both deletion and archiving:

```python
python
CopyEdit
import psycopg2
import boto3
import datetime

# Database connection
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=downtime_logs user=admin password=secret")

# Get the current date
current_date = datetime.datetime.now()

# Delete logs older than 2 years
delete_query = "DELETE FROM downtime_logs WHERE start_time < %s"
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(delete_query, (current_date - datetime.timedelta(days=730),))

# Archive old logs to S3 (if necessary)
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.upload_file('old_logs.zip', 'my-archive-bucket', 'old_logs.zip')

# Commit changes and close connection
conn.commit()
cursor.close()
conn.close()

```

**Retention for Compliance:**

A clear retention policy should also address **compliance** with regulations such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, or industry-specific standards. For example, sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) within the downtime logs might require deletion or anonymization after a certain period. Similarly, the audit period must align with the internal governance requirements and external regulatory frameworks.

In the case of sensitive data, logs should be encrypted before being moved to long-term storage, and all access to this data should be restricted and logged for compliance tracking.

**Monitoring and Alerts:**

Automated cleanup processes should be monitored to ensure they run successfully. Logs of cleanup actions can be stored in a separate log file, and notifications can be sent if any errors occur. For example, email alerts can be configured to notify the database administrator if the cleanup script fails, or if there is a problem with archiving data.

Additionally, periodic **audit checks** should be implemented to ensure that the retention policy is being followed and that the cleanup scripts are removing or archiving data as expected. Automated tests or scripts can be used to validate that no records are retained beyond the prescribed retention period.

**Data Purging for Performance Optimization:**

Beyond simple retention, **data purging** can be used to delete logs that are no longer necessary for business or operational purposes. Purging involves removing unnecessary logs, such as debug-level errors or logs from unimportant servers. These logs may consume space but add little value to long-term analysis. For example, logs marked with an `error_severity` of `'INFO'` or `'DEBUG'` might be purged after 30 days to ensure the database remains focused on critical events.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
DELETE FROM downtime_logs WHERE error_severity IN ('INFO', 'DEBUG') AND start_time < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

```

This type of data cleanup ensures that the database contains only meaningful, actionable information while reducing storage costs and improving query performance.
