# Data Retention & Cleanup Strategies for Incident Response Logs

Effective data retention and cleanup are **crucial** for maintaining a **fast, efficient, and cost-effective** database. Without proper policies, incident logs can **bloat the database**, slowing down queries and increasing storage costs. Below are **best practices and implementation strategies** for handling data retention and automated cleanup.

---

## **1. Defining Data Retention Policies**

### **Why Implement Data Retention?**

- **Optimizes database performance** by keeping the active dataset small.
- **Reduces storage costs** by archiving old incidents instead of keeping them in PostgreSQL.
- **Ensures compliance** with company policies and regulations (e.g., **GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2**).

### **Recommended Retention Periods**

| **Data Type** | **Retention Period** | **Reasoning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active incidents | **Until resolution** | Needed for immediate tracking. |
| Resolved incidents | **1-2 years** | Useful for audits & trend analysis. |
| Archived incidents | **3-5 years (data lake/cloud storage)** | For compliance & historical reports. |
| Security-related incidents | **5+ years** | Regulatory requirements. |
| Audit logs (modifications) | **5+ years** | Accountability tracking. |

ðŸ’¡ **Best Practice:** Store **active incidents in PostgreSQL**, then **archive old records** in a **separate table or data lake**.

---

## **2. Automating Cleanup for Old Incidents**

### **Approach 1: Scheduled Deletion of Old Resolved Incidents**

- **Goal:** Delete **resolved incidents older than a defined threshold** (e.g., 1-2 years).
- **How?** Use **PostgreSQL's `DELETE` command with a scheduler (e.g., `pg_cron`)**.

### **Example: Delete Incidents Older Than 2 Years**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
DELETE FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE status = 'Resolved' AND timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

```

ðŸ’¡ This ensures only **relevant incidents remain** in the active table.

### **Automating Cleanup with `pg_cron`**

- PostgreSQL **does not have a built-in job scheduler**, but `pg_cron` can be used.
- Install `pg_cron` and schedule a **monthly cleanup task**:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT cron.schedule('0 3 1 * *',  -- Runs on the 1st of every month at 3 AM
    $$ DELETE FROM incident_response_logs
       WHERE status = 'Resolved' AND timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years' $$);

```

ðŸ’¡ **Why?**

- **Runs automatically** in the background.
- **Prevents database bloat** by keeping only relevant data.

---

## **3. Archiving Old Data Instead of Deleting It**

### **Approach 2: Move Old Incidents to an Archive Table**

- Instead of deleting, **move resolved incidents older than 2 years** to an **archive table**.

### **Step 1: Create an Archive Table**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE TABLE archived_incidents AS
SELECT * FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE FALSE;  -- Creates an empty table with the same structure.

```

### **Step 2: Move Old Data to Archive Table**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
INSERT INTO archived_incidents
SELECT * FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE status = 'Resolved' AND timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

DELETE FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE status = 'Resolved' AND timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

```

ðŸ’¡ **Why?**

- **Keeps active tables small**, improving query performance.
- **Archived data is still accessible** for audits or reports.

### **Step 3: Automate Archiving with `pg_cron`**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT cron.schedule('0 4 1 * *',  -- Runs monthly at 4 AM
    $$ INSERT INTO archived_incidents
       SELECT * FROM incident_response_logs
       WHERE status = 'Resolved' AND timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

       DELETE FROM incident_response_logs
       WHERE status = 'Resolved' AND timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'; $$);

```

ðŸ’¡ **Now, old incidents are automatically archived every month.**

---

## **4. Offloading Archived Data to Cloud Storage (Data Lake)**

### **Approach 3: Export Archived Data to Cloud Storage (S3, BigQuery, etc.)**

For long-term storage, **move archived data to a data lake** (AWS S3, Google BigQuery, etc.).

### **Step 1: Export Archive Table as Parquet (Efficient for Big Data Queries)**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
COPY archived_incidents
TO '/path/to/s3/incidents_2024.parquet' WITH (FORMAT PARQUET);

```

ðŸ’¡ **Why Parquet?**

- **Compressed & optimized for analytical queries.**
- **Easier integration with BI tools (Snowflake, BigQuery, Athena).**

### **Step 2: Remove Archived Data from PostgreSQL**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
DELETE FROM archived_incidents WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 years';

```

ðŸ’¡ This prevents **long-term database storage costs**.

### **Step 3: Query Archived Data from a Data Lake**

Instead of keeping old incidents in PostgreSQL, use **Athena (AWS) or BigQuery (Google)**:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT * FROM my_s3_bucket.incidents_2024
WHERE server_id = 'srv-101';

```

ðŸ’¡ **Now, archived data is still available for reporting without slowing down PostgreSQL.**

---

## **5. Using Table Partitioning for Efficient Retention**

### **Approach 4: Partitioning by Year for Easy Cleanup**

- Instead of **storing all incidents in one table**, **partition them by year**.
- When an incident is **too old**, **simply drop the partition** (no complex DELETE operations).

### **Step 1: Create a Partitioned Table**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE TABLE incident_response_logs (
    incident_id UUID NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    response_team_id UUID,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    incident_type VARCHAR(100),
    resolution_time_minutes INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (incident_id, timestamp)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);

```

### **Step 2: Create Yearly Partitions**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE TABLE incident_response_logs_2024 PARTITION OF incident_response_logs
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

CREATE TABLE incident_response_logs_2023 PARTITION OF incident_response_logs
FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2024-01-01');

```

### **Step 3: Drop Old Partitions Instead of Running DELETE Queries**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
DROP TABLE incident_response_logs_2023;  -- Instantly removes all 2023 data.

```

ðŸ’¡ **Why?**

- **Dropping a partition is MUCH FASTER** than deleting rows one by one.
- **Keeps queries fast** by only scanning recent partitions.
