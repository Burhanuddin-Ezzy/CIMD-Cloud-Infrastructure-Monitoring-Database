# How It Interacts with Other Tables

The **Incident Response Logs** table plays a **central role** in tracking **system reliability, team performance, and financial impact**. It integrates with multiple tables to provide **a complete picture of incident management**.

### **Key Interactions with Other Tables**

### **1. `server_metrics` (Tracking Incident Impact on Server Performance)**

- **How It Connects:**
    - `incident_response_logs.server_id` â†’ `server_metrics.server_id`
- **Purpose:**
    - Helps analyze **server health before, during, and after** incidents.
    - Identifies **performance degradation patterns** caused by recurring issues.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT s.server_id, s.cpu_usage, s.memory_usage, i.incident_summary, i.timestamp
    FROM server_metrics s
    JOIN incident_response_logs i ON s.server_id = i.server_id
    WHERE i.timestamp BETWEEN s.timestamp - INTERVAL '5 minutes' AND s.timestamp + INTERVAL '5 minutes';
    
    ```
    
- **Why Itâ€™s Important:**
    - Allows **root cause analysis** by comparing incident times with **spikes in resource usage**.
    - Helps **predict potential failures** based on past incidents.

### **2. `team_management` (Tracking Which Teams Handle Incidents)**

- **How It Connects:**
    - `incident_response_logs.response_team_id` â†’ `team_management.team_id`
- **Purpose:**
    - Maps **each incident to the team responsible for handling it**.
    - Enables **team performance evaluation** (e.g., average response times).
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT t.team_name, COUNT(i.incident_id) AS total_incidents, AVG(i.resolution_time_minutes) AS avg_resolution_time
    FROM incident_response_logs i
    JOIN team_management t ON i.response_team_id = t.team_id
    GROUP BY t.team_name
    ORDER BY avg_resolution_time ASC;
    
    ```
    
- **Why Itâ€™s Important:**
    - Helps **identify high-performing teams** and **teams needing more resources/training**.
    - Ensures **clear accountability for incident response**.

### **3. `alert_history` (Correlating Alerts with Actual Incidents)**

- **How It Connects:**
    - `incident_response_logs.server_id` â†’ `alert_history.server_id`
    - `incident_response_logs.timestamp` â‰ˆ `alert_history.timestamp`
- **Purpose:**
    - **Links alerts to actual incidents**, verifying whether alerts accurately predict real problems.
    - **Tracks false alarms** by comparing alerts with logged incidents.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT a.alert_id, a.alert_type, i.incident_id, i.incident_summary
    FROM alert_history a
    LEFT JOIN incident_response_logs i
    ON a.server_id = i.server_id
    AND i.timestamp BETWEEN a.timestamp - INTERVAL '2 minutes' AND a.timestamp + INTERVAL '2 minutes'
    WHERE i.incident_id IS NULL;
    
    ```
    
- **Why Itâ€™s Important:**
    - Helps **reduce alert fatigue** by filtering out **false positives**.
    - Allows for **better tuning of alert thresholds** to improve monitoring accuracy.

### **4. `cost_data` (Calculating Financial Impact of Downtime & Incidents)**

- **How It Connects:**
    - `incident_response_logs.server_id` â†’ `cost_data.server_id`
    - `incident_response_logs.resolution_time_minutes` â†’ Used to estimate downtime costs.
- **Purpose:**
    - Calculates **financial losses** due to downtime, helping justify **infrastructure improvements**.
    - Helps **prioritize incident response based on cost impact**.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT i.incident_id, i.incident_summary, c.monthly_cost,
           (i.resolution_time_minutes / 60.0) * (c.monthly_cost / 730) AS estimated_downtime_cost
    FROM incident_response_logs i
    JOIN cost_data c ON i.server_id = c.server_id;
    
    ```
    
- **Why Itâ€™s Important:**
    - Provides **financial insights into incident management**.
    - Justifies investments in **fault-tolerant infrastructure** to minimize downtime losses.

### **5. `user_access_logs` (Checking Who Was Logged In During an Incident)**

- **How It Connects:**
    - `incident_response_logs.timestamp` â‰ˆ `user_access_logs.timestamp`
    - `incident_response_logs.server_id` â†’ `user_access_logs.server_id`
- **Purpose:**
    - Identifies **which users were logged in during an incident**, helping with **security investigations**.
    - Detects **potential unauthorized access** leading to system failures.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT u.user_id, u.access_time, i.incident_id, i.incident_summary
    FROM user_access_logs u
    JOIN incident_response_logs i
    ON u.server_id = i.server_id
    AND i.timestamp BETWEEN u.access_time - INTERVAL '5 minutes' AND u.access_time + INTERVAL '5 minutes';
    
    ```
    
- **Why Itâ€™s Important:**
    - Helps **identify whether human actions contributed to incidents**.
    - Supports **security audits & compliance** by tracking **user activity during failures**.

### **Summary of Key Table Interactions**

| Table | Purpose of Integration |
| --- | --- |
| `server_metrics` | Tracks how incidents impact server performance. |
| `team_management` | Identifies which teams handle incidents and their efficiency. |
| `alert_history` | Links alerts to actual incidents, reducing false positives. |
| `cost_data` | Calculates downtime costs from incidents. |
| `user_access_logs` | Determines which users accessed affected servers during incidents. |

### **Why These Interactions Matter**

These relationships **turn raw incident logs into actionable insights**:

âœ… **Enhances root cause analysis** by linking incidents to server performance.

âœ… **Improves team accountability** by tracking incident response times.

âœ… **Optimizes monitoring alerts** by correlating them with actual issues.

âœ… **Supports financial planning** by estimating the impact of downtime.

âœ… **Strengthens security** by associating incidents with user activity.

These integrations ensure that **incident response isn't just about fixing issuesâ€”but about learning, optimizing, and preventing future failures.** ðŸš€
