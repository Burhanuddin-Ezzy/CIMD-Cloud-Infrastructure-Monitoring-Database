# Alternative Approaches

Storing downtime logs in a **NoSQL database** (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) allows for a flexible schema, making it easier to accommodate evolving log structures and unstructured data. This approach is useful for high-ingestion scenarios where rigid schemas might slow down logging.

A **time-series database** like **Prometheus, InfluxDB, or TimescaleDB** provides optimized storage and retrieval for downtime trends, enabling real-time anomaly detection and predictive maintenance. These databases efficiently handle timestamped data and support built-in functions for monitoring system health over time.

Instead of explicitly logging both `start_time` and `end_time`, downtime duration could be inferred from **server metrics** by detecting **gaps in heartbeat signals** or CPU/memory activity. This reduces storage overhead and allows for dynamic event detection based on historical trends.

Another alternative is using a **streaming architecture** with Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis to process downtime events in real time. This would allow alerting and auto-remediation systems to act instantly when an outage is detected, reducing recovery time.

For cost efficiency, old downtime logs could be periodically **aggregated** into summary tables, keeping only essential statistics (e.g., total downtime per server per month) while moving detailed logs to **cold storage** (e.g., AWS S3, Google BigQuery) for long-term analysis.

Combining relational storage with event-driven architectures (e.g., **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation) can optimize performance by maintaining separate write-optimized and read-optimized storage layers, ensuring fast ingestion without slowing down query performance.

By choosing the right approach based on workload requirements, downtime tracking can be made **scalable, real-time, and cost-efficient**. ðŸš€
