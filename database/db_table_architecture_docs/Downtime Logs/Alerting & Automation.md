# Alerting & Automation

The system can be configured to **trigger alerts for repeated downtime on the same server**. If a server experiences multiple downtime incidents within a short time frame, it indicates a potential underlying issue. These alerts can be sent to the relevant team or engineer to investigate further. For example, if a server has more than three downtime incidents within a 24-hour period, an automated alert can be sent via **email**, **Slack**, or **PagerDuty**.

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT server_id, COUNT(*) AS downtime_count
FROM downtime_logs
WHERE start_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY server_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;

```

In this case, an alert can be generated for any server exceeding three downtime incidents, prompting further investigation into the root cause of the downtime.

Additionally, the system can **automate ticket creation** when downtime exceeds **SLA limits**. If downtime for a server surpasses the SLA-defined threshold, an automated incident ticket can be created in a ticket management system (such as **Jira** or **ServiceNow**) to ensure the downtime is tracked, investigated, and resolved in a timely manner. The system can also **assign tickets** to on-call engineers based on predefined rotation schedules.

Example for identifying downtime events that exceed SLA limits:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT * FROM downtime_logs
WHERE downtime_duration_minutes > 60 AND sla_tracking = TRUE;

```

An automated process can be triggered to create an incident ticket when the downtime exceeds 1 hour (or any other SLA-defined duration). The automation script would use the downtime logâ€™s information (e.g., server ID, downtime duration, start time) to create a new incident ticket.

For integration with **Jira**, the system can use the Jira REST API to create a ticket programmatically:

```python
python
CopyEdit
import requests
import json

def create_jira_ticket(server_id, downtime_duration):
    url = "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Basic YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "fields": {
            "project": {"key": "IT"},
            "summary": f"Server {server_id} Downtime Exceeded SLA",
            "description": f"Downtime duration: {downtime_duration} minutes.",
            "issuetype": {"name": "Bug"},
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    return response.json()

# Example usage
create_jira_ticket("Server_123", 120)

```

This automated integration can **create and assign the ticket** based on predefined criteria, ensuring no downtime event exceeds SLA limits without being tracked and resolved.

**Escalation Procedures**: If the downtime persists beyond a certain threshold (e.g., 2 hours without resolution), the system can trigger **escalation alerts** to senior engineers or managers. The escalation logic can be automated based on predefined rules such as:

- If the incident ticket is not resolved within **X hours**, escalate it to a higher level (e.g., Senior Engineer or Manager).
- Send a daily report summarizing all unresolved downtime incidents to the management team.

Example of triggering an escalation:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT * FROM downtime_logs
WHERE start_time < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
  AND resolved = FALSE
  AND sla_tracking = TRUE;

```

Automated notifications and ticket escalations ensure timely resolution of downtime incidents and maintain **SLA compliance**, improving overall system reliability and minimizing the impact of server failures.

**Proactive Monitoring**: The system can also **predict potential downtimes** based on historical data and trends. By analyzing previous downtime patterns, machine learning models can predict when a server is likely to experience failure. These predictions can be incorporated into the alerting system to send warnings before critical downtime events occur.

For example, using predictive analytics on server metrics like **CPU usage**, **disk I/O**, and **memory usage** to trigger **pre-emptive alerts** before actual downtime happens:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT server_id, cpu_usage, memory_usage
FROM server_metrics
WHERE cpu_usage > 90 OR memory_usage > 90
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;

```

If a server consistently shows high CPU usage or low memory, this can be flagged as a potential risk for future downtime, and an alert can be sent to the engineering team to investigate before failure occurs.

By automating alerts, ticket creation, escalation procedures, and implementing proactive monitoring, the system can ensure that downtime incidents are addressed quickly, minimize operational disruptions, and maintain high system availability.
