# Alerting & Automation

- **Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time alerting.**
    - **Why?** Real-time dashboards and alerting ensure that system failures are detected **immediately**.
    - **How?**
        - Use **Prometheus Alertmanager** to trigger alerts based on pre-defined thresholds.
        - Send alerts to **Grafana** dashboards for real-time monitoring.
    - **Example (Prometheus Alert Rule for High CPU Usage):**
        
        ```yaml
        yaml
        CopyEdit
        groups:
          - name: high_cpu_alerts
            rules:
              - alert: HighCPUUsage
                expr: avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) > 0.9
                for: 2m
                labels:
                  severity: critical
                annotations:
                  summary: "High CPU Usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
                  description: "CPU usage is above 90% for more than 2 minutes."
        
        ```
        
        - Ensures **instant notification** when CPU overload occurs.
- **Trigger automated resolution workflows for predictable issues.**
    - **Why?** Reduces manual intervention for repetitive or low-risk alerts.
    - **How?**
        - Use **webhooks** to trigger automation scripts when an alert is raised.
        - Integrate with **Ansible, Terraform, or Kubernetes Operators** to auto-remediate issues.
    - **Example (Trigger a Self-Healing Script for High Memory Usage):**
        
        ```yaml
        yaml
        CopyEdit
        - alert: HighMemoryUsage
          expr: node_memory_Active_bytes > 8GB
          for: 5m
          labels:
            severity: warning
          annotations:
            summary: "High Memory Usage"
            description: "Memory usage is high; running cleanup script."
          webhook: "http://automation-service/restart_service"
        
        ```
        
        - Calls an **endpoint** that automatically **restarts services** or clears caches.
- **Escalate unresolved alerts through notification channels.**
    - **Why?** Ensures critical alerts **reach the right teams** via email, Slack, or PagerDuty.
    - **How?**
        - Define **alert severity levels** and map them to different escalation policies.
        - Use **PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or Twilio SMS** for urgent notifications.
    - **Example (Escalation Workflow for Critical Alerts):**
        
        ```yaml
        yaml
        CopyEdit
        - alert: DatabaseDown
          expr: pg_up == 0
          for: 1m
          labels:
            severity: critical
          annotations:
            summary: "Database is Down"
            description: "No response from PostgreSQL. Escalating to on-call team."
          pagerduty: "database_incident"
        
        ```
        
        - Ensures **on-call engineers are notified immediately** when a database failure occurs.
- **Use AI/ML-based anomaly detection for smarter alerts.**
    - **Why?** Prevents **false positives** by learning normal system behavior.
    - **How?**
        - Train a **machine learning model** on past alert data.
        - Use **unsupervised learning (e.g., Isolation Forest, DBSCAN)** to detect anomalies.
    - **Example (Using ML for CPU Anomaly Detection):**
        
        ```python
        python
        CopyEdit
        from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
        import numpy as np
        
        # Load past CPU usage data
        cpu_data = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.9, 0.8, 0.92, 0.15, 0.2]).reshape(-1, 1)
        
        # Train anomaly detection model
        model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
        model.fit(cpu_data)
        
        # Detect anomalies
        new_cpu_usage = np.array([[0.98]])  # New incoming data
        print(model.predict(new_cpu_usage))  # If -1, it's an anomaly
        
        ```
        
        - Detects **unusual CPU spikes** and avoids **alert fatigue**.
- **Automatically generate incident reports for post-mortems.**
    - **Why?** Helps teams analyze **why incidents happened** and prevent future failures.
    - **How?**
        - Use **SQL queries** to pull alert logs and **auto-generate reports**.
        - Integrate with **JIRA or Confluence** to log incidents automatically.
    - **Example (Auto-Generate Incident Reports from PostgreSQL Data):**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT
            alert_type,
            COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count,
            AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, alert_triggered_at, resolved_at)) AS avg_resolution_time
        FROM alert_history
        WHERE alert_triggered_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
        GROUP BY alert_type
        ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;
        
        ```
        
        - Generates **monthly reports** for incident analysis.
- **Integrate with ITSM (IT Service Management) platforms.**
    - **Why?** Helps **track and resolve alerts as tickets** in platforms like ServiceNow.
    - **How?**
        - Configure **ServiceNow API** to create incident tickets from alerts.
    - **Example (Creating a ServiceNow Ticket from an Alert):**
        
        ```json
        json
        CopyEdit
        {
          "short_description": "High CPU Usage Alert",
          "priority": "2",
          "assigned_to": "infra_team",
          "description": "Server X has exceeded CPU threshold. Immediate action required."
        }
        
        ```
        
        - Ensures alerts **are properly tracked and resolved**.
