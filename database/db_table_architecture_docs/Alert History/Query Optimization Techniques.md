# Query Optimization Techniques

- **Materialized views for frequently queried alert trends.**
    - **Why?** Running aggregate queries repeatedly on large datasets is expensive.
    - **How?**
        - Use **materialized views** to precompute common alert trends (e.g., most frequent alert types).
        - Schedule periodic **refreshes** to update the view without impacting query performance.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW frequent_alerts AS
        SELECT alert_type, COUNT(*) AS alert_count
        FROM alert_history
        WHERE alert_triggered_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
        GROUP BY alert_type
        ORDER BY alert_count DESC;
        
        ```
        
        - Use `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` on a schedule to keep it updated.
- **Partitioned tables by month for efficient historical data retrieval.**
    - **Why?** Searching across millions of alerts in a single table slows down performance.
    - **How?**
        - Use **time-based partitioning** so queries on recent alerts don’t scan unnecessary data.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE alert_history_2024_01 PARTITION OF alert_history
        FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-01-31');
        
        ```
        
        - Improves query performance when retrieving alerts from a specific time range.
- **Indexing `alert_triggered_at` for range-based queries.**
    - **Why?** Time-based filtering (`WHERE alert_triggered_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'`) is common.
    - **How?**
        - Adding a **B-tree index** on `alert_triggered_at` speeds up range queries.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_alert_time ON alert_history (alert_triggered_at);
        
        ```
        
        - Optimizes performance for dashboard filters showing alerts over the past week or month.
- **Covering indexes to optimize `SELECT` queries.**
    - **Why?** Queries fetching specific columns should avoid unnecessary reads.
    - **How?**
        - Use a **covering index** (`server_id, alert_status, alert_triggered_at`) for filtering and sorting efficiently.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_alert_status_time ON alert_history (server_id, alert_status, alert_triggered_at);
        
        ```
        
        - Ensures that queries filtering by server and status are faster.
- **Query execution plan analysis (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`).**
    - **Why?** PostgreSQL's query planner can suggest optimizations based on execution statistics.
    - **How?**
        - Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify slow queries and optimize indexes accordingly.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        EXPLAIN ANALYZE
        SELECT alert_type, COUNT(*)
        FROM alert_history
        WHERE alert_triggered_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
        GROUP BY alert_type;
        
        ```
        
        - Helps identify bottlenecks, like missing indexes or full table scans.
- **Using `UNLOGGED` tables for temporary high-frequency alert data.**
    - **Why?** If some alerts don’t need durability (e.g., temporary real-time alerts), skipping WAL logs speeds up inserts.
    - **How?**
        - Create **unlogged tables** for non-critical alerts that don’t require replication.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE temp_alerts AS
        SELECT * FROM alert_history WHERE alert_triggered_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
        
        ```
        
        - Avoids the overhead of WAL (write-ahead logging), making writes faster.
- **Connection pooling to optimize high-volume query execution.**
    - **Why?** High alert frequency means many concurrent database queries.
    - **How?**
        - Use **PgBouncer** or a similar pooling tool to manage database connections efficiently.
    - **Example:**
        - Configure a **connection pool** with a limit of active sessions to prevent overloading PostgreSQL.
