# Performance Considerations & Scalability

- **Indexing `server_id` and `alert_status` optimizes open alert lookups.**
    - **Why?** Frequently querying active alerts (e.g., `WHERE alert_status = 'OPEN'`) needs to be fast.
    - **How?**
        - Create an **index on `server_id` and `alert_status`** to speed up queries that filter alerts by server and status.
        - Use a **composite index (`server_id`, `alert_status`)** for faster retrieval of unresolved alerts.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_alert_status ON alert_history (server_id, alert_status);
        
        ```
        
        - This significantly reduces scan time when fetching open alerts for a server.
- **Partitioning by `alert_triggered_at` speeds up historical queries.**
    - **Why?** Querying past alerts over large datasets slows down performance if all alerts are stored in a single table.
    - **How?**
        - Use **table partitioning by month or year**, making it easier to retrieve recent vs. historical data.
        - PostgreSQL supports **time-based partitioning** where older alerts are stored separately.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE alert_history_2024 PARTITION OF alert_history
        FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-12-31');
        
        ```
        
        - This ensures **queries on recent alerts** don’t scan unnecessary historical data.
- **Purging old alerts or archiving them prevents table bloat.**
    - **Why?** Keeping all alerts indefinitely can degrade query performance.
    - **How?**
        - Implement an **automated cleanup job** that moves old alerts to an archive table.
        - Use **time-to-live (TTL) policies** for automatic deletion of non-critical alerts after a set period.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        DELETE FROM alert_history WHERE alert_triggered_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
        
        ```
        
        - Keeps the table size manageable while retaining necessary historical data.
- **Asynchronous alert processing reduces database load.**
    - **Why?** Writing every alert immediately may slow down transaction speeds.
    - **How?**
        - Use a **message queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ)** to process alerts asynchronously instead of inserting them synchronously.
        - Store critical alerts immediately while **batch-processing lower-priority ones** in the background.
    - **Example:**
        - Instead of writing alerts directly to the database, **send them to a queue first**, then process them in batches.
- **Sharding strategy for handling high-traffic environments.**
    - **Why?** If the system scales to handle **millions of alerts per day**, a single database instance may not be sufficient.
    - **How?**
        - Use **sharding by `server_id`** so each server’s alerts are distributed across multiple database instances.
        - Implement **read replicas** for handling heavy query loads.
    - **Example:**
        - A company with thousands of monitored servers **splits alerts across multiple database nodes** for better performance.
- **Compression techniques for reducing storage costs.**
    - **Why?** Alert history tables can grow large, leading to high storage costs.
    - **How?**
        - Enable **PostgreSQL’s column-level compression** for text fields.
        - Store older, infrequently accessed alerts in a **compressed archive table**.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        ALTER TABLE alert_history SET (autovacuum_enabled = false);
        
        ```
        
        - Disables automatic vacuuming on archived tables to save resources.
