# Alternative Approaches

- **Using NoSQL for Flexible Cost Structures**
    - **Why?** Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure have highly granular and dynamic billing models that may not fit well in a rigid relational schema.
    - **How?** A NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB or DynamoDB) could store cost breakdowns per service, region, or even individual API requests in a hierarchical format.
    - **Trade-off:** This approach sacrifices structured SQL queries but provides flexibility for unpredictable billing models.
- **Storing Daily Costs Instead of Monthly Aggregates**
    - **Why?** Instead of precomputing and storing `total_monthly_cost`, it may be better to store daily records (`cost_per_day`) and compute monthly totals on the fly.
    - **How?**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT server_id, SUM(cost_per_day) AS total_monthly_cost
        FROM daily_cost_data
        WHERE timestamp >= DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())
        GROUP BY server_id;
        
        ```
        
    - **Trade-off:** This approach saves storage space by eliminating redundant aggregates but requires more computation at query time.
- **Keeping Cost Data in a Separate Analytics Warehouse**
    - **Why?** Large-scale cost tracking can generate massive datasets, and running analytical queries on the operational database can slow down performance.
    - **How?** A data warehouse like **Google BigQuery, Snowflake, or Amazon Redshift** can store cost data separately, allowing for complex analytical queries.
    - **Trade-off:** Requires an ETL process to sync operational cost data with the warehouse, introducing potential delays in real-time analysis.
- **Event-Driven Cost Processing**
    - **Why?** Instead of periodically inserting cost data, an event-driven approach could trigger updates only when a significant change occurs.
    - **How?**
        - Cloud providers offer event hooks (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management) that can trigger functions to update cost data when charges change.
        - A **Kafka-based event stream** could capture real-time cost changes for high-frequency tracking.
    - **Trade-off:** Reduces unnecessary writes to the database but adds complexity with real-time event processing.
- **Using Machine Learning for Cost Predictions**
    - **Why?** Organizations can proactively adjust infrastructure based on predicted cost trends.
    - **How?** Training a model on historical cost data to forecast future spending, using algorithms like **ARIMA, LSTMs, or Gradient Boosting**.
    - **Example Query for Training Data:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT timestamp, total_monthly_cost FROM cost_data ORDER BY timestamp;
        
        ```
        
    - **Trade-off:** Requires extra computation and tuning but enables proactive cost management.
