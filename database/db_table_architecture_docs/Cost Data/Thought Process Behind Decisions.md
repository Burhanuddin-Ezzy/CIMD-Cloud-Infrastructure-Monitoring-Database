# Thought Process Behind Decisions

The design of the **Cost Data** schema was carefully considered to balance the **need for real-time tracking** with **system efficiency**. This approach ensures financial accuracy, minimizes computational overhead, and supports the scalability requirements of large, dynamic infrastructures. Here are the key decisions and thought processes behind the design:

---

### **1. Real-Time Cost Tracking vs. Query Efficiency**

**Why:** The goal was to ensure **up-to-date financial tracking** for operational expenses while keeping the system **responsive** for analysis and reporting.

- **Aggregated Values for Performance:**
    
    By including fields like `total_monthly_cost` in the table, we avoid **real-time recalculation of costs** each time a query is run. This reduces the **computational overhead** for frequently run reports (e.g., monthly cost summaries, department budgets) and enables quicker analysis.
    
    - Example: **`total_monthly_cost`** is precomputed and stored instead of recalculating it with each query for all records.
    - **Trade-off:** This introduces some additional **storage overhead**, but the trade-off is worth it in terms of performance when generating reports.
- **Real-Time Tracking with `cost_per_hour`:**
    
    **Dynamic costs** (e.g., `cost_per_hour`) are captured on a per-server basis to allow for **real-time monitoring of server costs**, while the **total aggregated costs** are used for less frequent, larger-scale calculations.

### **2. Simplifying Data Relationships with Fewer Joins**

**Why:** Avoiding complex joins helps reduce database load and complexity, especially in high-frequency queries.

- **`region` as a Column Instead of a Separate Table:**
    
    The **geographical region** of each server is stored directly as a `VARCHAR(20)` column instead of a foreign key referencing a separate `regions` table.
    
    - **Why:** Cloud providers typically have a **finite set of regions** that remain fairly constant, so it’s not worth the extra overhead of managing a **separate lookup table**.
    - **Benefit:** This choice simplifies queries because **joins with the `region` table** are not necessary, leading to faster, simpler queries.
    - **Trade-off:** There’s a slight **loss of flexibility** in terms of adding more complex region-related metadata later on (e.g., different pricing models for each region), but for now, this decision supports both **performance and simplicity**.
- **Avoiding Redundant Joins:**
    
    By keeping the cost structure straightforward with **direct references** to the `server_id` and `region`, we eliminate the need for **multiple joins** when querying cost data, especially when combined with the **`resource_allocation`** and **`server_metrics`** tables.
    
    - Example: A query to find **cost per region** can simply reference the `region` column in the `cost_data` table without needing to join an additional regions table.

### **3. Financial Accuracy with Precomputed Columns**

**Why:** Financial data requires **precision** and **consistency** to ensure accurate reporting and billing.

- **Precomputing Values for Financial Consistency:**The schema includes precomputed columns like `total_monthly_cost`, which aggregate costs at a more granular level (i.e., **server-level costs**) to provide **faster access** for reporting purposes.
    - **Benefit:** This approach ensures that **costs are consistent** and avoids discrepancies that could arise from recalculating totals on-the-fly, especially in **high-volume systems** where fluctuations may occur.
    - **Trade-off:** There is a minor risk that the **precomputed values might become outdated** if underlying data changes, but this risk is mitigated by **scheduled updates** and automated checks.

---

### **4. Scalability for Large Infrastructures**

**Why:** With large-scale cloud infrastructure, managing vast amounts of cost data efficiently is essential for both **cost optimization** and **reporting**.

- **Partitioning and Indexing:**
    
    **Partitioning** the table by attributes such as `region` allows for more efficient queries when retrieving cost data for specific geographic areas.
    
    - **Why:** Servers are often distributed across multiple regions, and cost tracking is typically required per-region, so **partitioning by region** makes the table more **scalable** by enabling the database engine to only scan relevant partitions for cost analysis.
    - **Trade-off:** Partitioning introduces a bit of complexity in maintaining the partition structure but offers **major performance benefits** in the long run when handling large amounts of data.
- **Indexing for Fast Lookups:**
    
    Adding **indexes on columns** such as `server_id` and `timestamp` ensures that queries for cost tracking are executed efficiently, even with large datasets.
    
    - **Why:** The **`timestamp`** index speeds up queries for **historical cost trends** and allows for quick retrieval of **recent costs**.
    - **Benefit:** **Performance optimization** through indexing provides faster query execution times and better responsiveness for large-scale data.

### **5. Supporting Internal Financial Accountability**

**Why:** The schema is designed not only for **cost tracking** but also for **internal accountability** across teams and departments.

- **`team_allocation` for Internal Budgeting:**The **`team_allocation`** field links the cost of the server to specific departments or teams, supporting **internal financial accountability**.
    - **Why:** This allows teams to track and manage their own server usage and **align costs with team budgets**.
    - **Benefit:** The ability to break down costs at the **team or department level** supports budgeting, forecasting, and **resource allocation management** within an organization.
    - **Trade-off:** Some flexibility is lost in terms of **more granular cost categories** (e.g., individual cost breakdowns for different cloud services), but the approach is **practical** for most enterprises.

---

### **6. Support for Future Flexibility & Extensibility**

**Why:** As cloud infrastructure grows and evolves, the schema is designed to adapt and support future requirements.

- **Future-Proof Design:**The current schema supports **basic cost tracking**, but it can be extended for future use cases like multi-cloud cost management, granular cost categorization (e.g., storage, compute), and detailed **cost forecasting** models.
    - **Why:** The use of flexible data types like `VARCHAR` for `team_allocation` and `region` makes it easy to adapt the schema to new requirements without requiring a major redesign.
    - **Benefit:** The schema remains **extensible**, making it easier to add new fields or tables to accommodate future business needs (e.g., adding **cost breakdowns for specific cloud services**).
