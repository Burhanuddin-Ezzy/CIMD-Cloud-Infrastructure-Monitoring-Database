# Team Allocation Handbook

## What is `team_allocation`?

The `team_allocation` field in the Cost Data table indicates **which team or function within an organization is responsible for a given server's cost**. This helps in tracking and distributing infrastructure costs fairly across different departments, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Why is `team_allocation` Important?

1. **Cost Transparency** – Organizations can see which teams are consuming the most cloud resources.
2. **Budgeting & Forecasting** – Helps finance teams plan budgets based on team-specific cloud expenditures.
3. **Optimization & Cost Reduction** – Identifying high-cost teams enables better resource allocation.
4. **Internal Billing (Chargeback Models)** – If teams have separate budgets, expenses can be billed accordingly.

## How is `team_allocation` Determined?

### **1️⃣ Resource Tagging**

Cloud providers allow tagging of resources with metadata such as:

- `team_allocation = "AI Research"`
- `team_allocation = "DevOps"`
- `team_allocation = "Marketing Analytics"`

These tags can be manually set or assigned automatically based on predefined rules.

### **2️⃣ Project-Based Allocation**

Each server may be linked to a project, and projects are assigned to teams. Example:

- A server running deep learning models belongs to `"AI Research"`
- A database server supporting a customer portal belongs to `"Web Development"`

### **3️⃣ User & Access Tracking**

Logs from authentication systems (IAM roles, user activity logs) help determine **which users or teams access a server**. If all activity originates from DevOps engineers, the server is allocated to `"DevOps"`.

### **4️⃣ Service Ownership & Billing Reports**

Cloud providers often generate cost reports based on **who requested the server** and **who is using it**.

### **5️⃣ Network & Application Monitoring**

By analyzing running services and traffic patterns, it’s possible to link usage to a particular team.

- If a server is hosting a business intelligence tool, it likely belongs to `"Data Analytics"`
- If it’s hosting a marketing campaign website, it’s assigned to `"Marketing"`

## Examples of `team_allocation` Usage

### **Example 1: Cost Breakdown by Team**

A query like this can provide insight into spending by team:

```
SELECT team_allocation, SUM(total_monthly_cost) AS total_spent
FROM CostData
GROUP BY team_allocation;
```

### **Sample Output:**

```
team_allocation      | total_spent
-------------------- | ------------
DevOps               | $1,500.00
AI Research          | $3,200.00
Marketing            | $2,400.00
Finance              | $800.00
```

This shows which teams are consuming the most resources and where cost optimizations might be needed.

### **Example 2: Identifying High-Cost Servers by Team**

```
SELECT server_id, team_allocation, cost_per_hour
FROM CostData
WHERE cost_per_hour > 5.00;
```

### **Sample Output:**

```
server_id  | team_allocation  | cost_per_hour
---------- | ---------------- | -------------
s1a2b3     | AI Research      | $6.50
s4c5d6     | DevOps           | $5.75
```

This helps identify expensive servers and determine if cost-saving measures are needed.

### **Example 3: Allocating Costs Based on Usage**

If a server is used by multiple teams, costs may be split based on usage percentage:

```
SELECT team_allocation,
       (SUM(cpu_usage) / (SELECT SUM(cpu_usage) FROM UsageData)) * total_monthly_cost AS adjusted_cost
FROM UsageData
JOIN CostData USING(server_id)
GROUP BY team_allocation;
```

### **Sample Output:**

```
team_allocation      | adjusted_cost
-------------------- | -------------
DevOps               | $1,200.00
AI Research          | $1,800.00
Marketing            | $1,500.00
```

This ensures fair cost distribution when multiple teams use shared resources.

## Best Practices for Managing `team_allocation`

- **Use Automated Tagging Policies** – Enforce tagging rules in cloud platforms to automatically assign `team_allocation`.
- **Regularly Audit Team Allocations** – Ensure servers are correctly attributed to the right teams.
- **Optimize Costs by Team** – If a team has high usage, investigate possible optimizations like rightsizing instances.
- **Implement Chargeback Models** – Bill teams based on their actual usage for financial accountability.

## Summary

The `team_allocation` field is essential for tracking and managing cloud costs across different teams. By implementing structured tagging, access tracking, and cost analysis queries, organizations can ensure fair cost distribution, optimize budgets, and improve overall financial transparency.
