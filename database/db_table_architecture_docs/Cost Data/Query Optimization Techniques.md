# Query Optimization Techniques

- **Materialized Views for Monthly Summaries Avoid Repeated Aggregations**
    - **Why?** Aggregating cost data on every query can be slow, especially for large datasets. Using **materialized views** precomputes results, making reports significantly faster.
    - **How?**
        - Create a **materialized view** to store precomputed monthly costs:
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_cost_summary AS
            SELECT region, team_allocation, SUM(total_monthly_cost) AS total_cost
            FROM cost_data
            GROUP BY region, team_allocation;
            
            ```
            
        - **Refresh the view periodically** to keep data up to date:
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_cost_summary;
            
            ```
            
        - **Performance Gain:**
            - Instead of scanning thousands of rows, queries on **monthly_cost_summary** use precomputed results.
            - **Trade-off:** Materialized views need manual or scheduled updates, so real-time cost changes might not reflect immediately.
- **Using Batch Inserts Instead of Frequent Updates for Efficiency**
    - **Why?** Inserting cost data row-by-row increases I/O overhead. **Batch inserts** minimize database transactions, improving efficiency.
    - **How?**
        - **Instead of inserting records one by one:**
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            INSERT INTO cost_data (server_id, region, timestamp, cost_per_hour, total_monthly_cost, team_allocation)
            VALUES ('uuid1', 'us-east-1', '2025-02-16', 0.25, 180, 'Engineering');
            INSERT INTO cost_data (server_id, region, timestamp, cost_per_hour, total_monthly_cost, team_allocation)
            VALUES ('uuid2', 'eu-west-1', '2025-02-16', 0.30, 220, 'Marketing');
            
            ```
            
        - **Use batch inserts instead:**
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            INSERT INTO cost_data (server_id, region, timestamp, cost_per_hour, total_monthly_cost, team_allocation)
            VALUES
            ('uuid1', 'us-east-1', '2025-02-16', 0.25, 180, 'Engineering'),
            ('uuid2', 'eu-west-1', '2025-02-16', 0.30, 220, 'Marketing'),
            ('uuid3', 'ap-south-1', '2025-02-16', 0.28, 190, 'Sales');
            
            ```
            
        - **Performance Gain:**
            - **Fewer transactions** → Less overhead → **Faster inserts**
            - Reduces **disk I/O and lock contention**
            - **Trade-off:** Requires data to be **collected first**, instead of inserting row-by-row in real-time.
- **Index-Only Scans to Speed Up Read Queries**
    - **Why?** Standard queries scan both indexes and actual table rows. **Index-only scans** retrieve data **entirely from the index**, avoiding unnecessary disk access.
    - **How?**
        - Ensure queries **only use indexed columns**:
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            CREATE INDEX idx_team_cost ON cost_data(team_allocation, total_monthly_cost);
            
            ```
            
        - Then, this query benefits from an **index-only scan**:
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            SELECT team_allocation, total_monthly_cost FROM cost_data WHERE team_allocation = 'Engineering';
            
            ```
            
        - **Performance Gain:**
            - Faster lookups, as PostgreSQL doesn’t need to access the actual table.
            - **Trade-off:** Index-only scans work best when **`cost_data` is mostly static**. If cost updates are frequent, PostgreSQL may still check the main table.
- **Avoiding SELECT * for Better Query Performance**
    - **Why?** `SELECT *` fetches all columns, even if some are unnecessary, increasing query load.
    - **How?**
        - Instead of:
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            SELECT * FROM cost_data WHERE region = 'us-east-1';
            
            ```
            
        - Use:
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            SELECT region, total_monthly_cost FROM cost_data WHERE region = 'us-east-1';
            
            ```
            
        - **Performance Gain:**
            - Reduces **network overhead** and memory usage.
            - **Trade-off:** Needs careful query structuring to avoid missing required columns.
- **Query Caching for Repetitive Cost Reports**
    - **Why?** Repetitive queries (e.g., "Total Cost Per Region") can be cached to avoid hitting the database every time.
    - **How?**
        - Use **PostgreSQL’s `pgbouncer`** for connection pooling.
        - Store results in **Redis** and refresh periodically:
            
            ```python
            python
            CopyEdit
            import redis
            cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
            key = "total_cost_per_region"
            if not cache.exists(key):
                result = run_sql_query("SELECT region, SUM(total_monthly_cost) FROM cost_data GROUP BY region;")
                cache.setex(key, 3600, result)  # Cache expires in 1 hour
            
            ```
            
        - **Performance Gain:**
            - **Reduces load** on the database.
            - Speeds up cost report generation.
            - **Trade-off:** Cached results might be **slightly outdated**.
