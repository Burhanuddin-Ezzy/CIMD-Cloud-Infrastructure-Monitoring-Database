# Security & Compliance for Aggregated Metrics

Securing **aggregated performance metrics** is crucial to **prevent unauthorized access, ensure regulatory compliance, and safeguard sensitive data**. Below are advanced **security measures** that align with **industry best practices** while ensuring efficient **data governance**.

---

### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Secure Data Access**

**Why It Matters?**

- Prevents unauthorized users from accessing **sensitive performance or cost data**.
- Ensures that **only relevant teams** (finance, operations, security) can access their respective metrics.

**How It Works?**

- Implement **fine-grained permissions** using **PostgreSQL roles**.
- **Restrict access to cost-related metrics** so that **only finance teams** can query financial data.

**Implementation:**

- **Create roles for different teams**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE ROLE finance_team;
    CREATE ROLE operations_team;
    
    ```
    
- **Grant access only to relevant tables**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    GRANT SELECT ON aggregated_metrics TO operations_team;
    GRANT SELECT ON cost_data TO finance_team;
    
    ```
    
- **Ensure sensitive financial data isnâ€™t exposed to other teams**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    REVOKE SELECT ON cost_data FROM operations_team;
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive financial data.**

âœ… **Ensures teams only see the data relevant to their roles.**

### **2. GDPR Compliance â€“ Anonymization & Data Masking**

**Why It Matters?**

- Protects **personally identifiable information (PII)** while retaining useful aggregated insights.
- Ensures compliance with **GDPR, CCPA, and other data privacy laws**.

**How It Works?**

- **Anonymize sensitive data** before storing it.
- Use **data masking** when displaying information to unauthorized users.

**Implementation:**

- **Anonymize unnecessary personal identifiers (e.g., IP addresses, usernames)**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    UPDATE aggregated_metrics
    SET server_id = md5(server_id::TEXT)
    WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
    
    ```
    
- **Mask sensitive fields for non-admin users**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE VIEW masked_aggregated_metrics AS
    SELECT
        server_id,
        region,
        hourly_avg_cpu_usage,
        CASE
            WHEN current_user != 'admin' THEN 'MASKED'
            ELSE peak_network_usage::TEXT
        END AS peak_network_usage
    FROM aggregated_metrics;
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Ensures compliance with GDPR & CCPA regulations.**

âœ… **Protects sensitive data while maintaining usability.**

### **3. Column-Level Encryption for Sensitive Fields**

**Why It Matters?**

- Prevents attackers from reading sensitive data even if the database is breached.
- Ensures compliance with **HIPAA, PCI-DSS**, and other data protection standards.

**How It Works?**

- Encrypt sensitive columns such as **server_id, cost_data, and network traffic logs**.
- Use **PostgreSQLâ€™s pgcrypto** extension to store encrypted data securely.

**Implementation:**

- **Enable pgcrypto for column encryption**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
    
    ```
    
- **Encrypt `server_id` before storing it**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    UPDATE aggregated_metrics
    SET server_id = pgp_sym_encrypt(server_id::TEXT, 'encryption_key');
    
    ```
    
- **Decrypt only when needed**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT pgp_sym_decrypt(server_id, 'encryption_key') FROM aggregated_metrics;
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Adds an extra layer of security in case of a data breach.**

âœ… **Ensures only authorized users can decrypt sensitive data.**

---

### **4. Secure Data Transmission (TLS/SSL Encryption)**

**Why It Matters?**

- Prevents **man-in-the-middle attacks** by encrypting database traffic.
- Ensures **secure data exchange** between the database and monitoring systems.

**How It Works?**

- Enforce **TLS encryption** on all database connections.
- Reject non-encrypted connections to prevent **data leaks**.

**Implementation:**

- **Enable SSL in PostgreSQL**
    
    ```
    conf
    CopyEdit
    ssl = on
    ssl_cert_file = '/etc/ssl/certs/postgres.crt'
    ssl_key_file = '/etc/ssl/private/postgres.key'
    
    ```
    
- **Force secure connections**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl = 'on';
    ALTER ROLE monitoring_user SET sslmode = 'require';
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Prevents data interception during transmission.**

âœ… **Ensures all queries and responses are securely encrypted.**

---

### **5. Auditing & Logging for Compliance**

**Why It Matters?**

- Helps in **detecting suspicious activity** and **meeting compliance requirements**.
- Provides a **detailed history** of all queries and data modifications.

**How It Works?**

- Log all queries that access **sensitive metrics**.
- **Monitor database access** using an audit trail.

**Implementation:**

- **Enable query logging in PostgreSQL**
    
    ```
    conf
    CopyEdit
    logging_collector = on
    log_statement = 'all'
    log_connections = on
    log_disconnections = on
    
    ```
    
- **Store logs in a secure location**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE TABLE audit_log (
        event_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
        user_name TEXT,
        query TEXT
    );
    
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_query() RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO audit_log(user_name, query) VALUES (current_user, current_query());
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    
    CREATE EVENT TRIGGER audit_queries
    ON ddl_command_start
    EXECUTE FUNCTION log_query();
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

âœ… **Tracks every access and modification of aggregated metrics.**

âœ… **Provides a detailed audit log for compliance.**
