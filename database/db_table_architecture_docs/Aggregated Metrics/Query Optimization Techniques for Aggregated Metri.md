# Query Optimization Techniques for Aggregated Metrics

Efficiently querying **large-scale aggregated metric data** requires careful **performance tuning**. The goal is to ensure **fast retrieval**, **minimize database load**, and **scale for high-volume data ingestion**. Below are advanced techniques to **optimize queries** while keeping the database responsive.

---

### **1. Batch Processing Instead of Real-Time Writes**

**Why It Matters?**

- Avoids **high-frequency insert contention**, which can slow down the database.
- Allows efficient **bulk inserts** instead of inserting every metric update individually.

**How It Works?**

- **Collect data in memory (or a buffer)** before inserting into the database at fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
- Use **background processing tools** (e.g., PostgreSQLâ€™s `pg_cron`, Apache Kafka, or Celery workers).
- **Example: Using pg_cron for batch inserts every 5 minutes:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT pg_cron.schedule('*/5 * * * *', $$
        INSERT INTO aggregated_metrics (server_id, region, hourly_avg_cpu_usage, hourly_avg_memory_usage, peak_network_usage, peak_disk_usage, uptime_percentage, timestamp)
        SELECT server_id, region, AVG(cpu_usage), AVG(memory_usage), MAX(network_usage), MAX(disk_usage), AVG(uptime), NOW()
        FROM server_metrics
        WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
        GROUP BY server_id, region
    $$);
    
    ```
    
- **Benefits**âœ… Reduces **write amplification** and improves **transaction throughput**.âœ… Keeps **hot tables lightweight** by **minimizing row-level locks**.

### **2. Creating Summary Tables for Long-Term Trends**

**Why It Matters?**

- Historical queries on raw data can be slow.
- Pre-aggregated **daily, weekly, and monthly summaries** speed up long-term trend analysis.

**How It Works?**

- Use **daily, weekly, or monthly summary tables** instead of scanning raw data.
- **Example: Creating a daily summary table for fast trend lookups**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE TABLE daily_summary AS
    SELECT
        server_id,
        region,
        DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day,
        AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) AS avg_cpu_usage,
        AVG(hourly_avg_memory_usage) AS avg_memory_usage,
        MAX(peak_network_usage) AS max_network_usage,
        MAX(peak_disk_usage) AS max_disk_usage,
        AVG(uptime_percentage) AS avg_uptime
    FROM aggregated_metrics
    GROUP BY server_id, region, day;
    
    ```
    
- **Refresh Strategy:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_summary WITH DATA;
    
    ```
    
- **Benefits**âœ… **Massive query performance boost** for historical analysis.âœ… Reduces load on **primary metrics tables**, keeping queries **lightweight**.

### **3. Indexing for Fast Aggregation Queries**

**Why It Matters?**

- Without proper indexes, **aggregation queries on millions of rows** can be slow.
- Indexing **common filters & joins** ensures queries remain fast.

**How It Works?**

- **Index on `timestamp` for fast range scans:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON aggregated_metrics (timestamp DESC);
    
    ```
    
- **Index on `server_id` for quick lookups by server:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE INDEX idx_server_id ON aggregated_metrics (server_id);
    
    ```
    
- **Partial Indexing: Only index "active" rows** for real-time queries:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE INDEX idx_active_uptime ON aggregated_metrics (uptime_percentage) WHERE uptime_percentage < 99.9;
    
    ```
    
- **Benefits**âœ… **Speeds up time-based queries** significantly.âœ… Reduces **full-table scans**, making dashboards highly responsive.

### **4. Using Window Functions for Efficient Querying**

**Why It Matters?**

- **Avoids expensive subqueries or joins** by calculating rolling averages in a single pass.
- Helps in generating **trending reports** on-the-fly without needing pre-aggregated tables.

**How It Works?**

- **Rolling average CPU usage over the past 7 days per server:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT server_id, region, timestamp,
           AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) OVER (PARTITION BY server_id ORDER BY timestamp ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_cpu
    FROM aggregated_metrics;
    
    ```
    
- **Benefits**âœ… More efficient than **self-joins or subqueries**.âœ… Enables **real-time trend analysis** without storing redundant data.

### **5. Leveraging Caching for Frequently Accessed Queries**

**Why It Matters?**

- Reduces **database load** by caching repeated queries.
- Keeps **dashboards fast** without executing queries on every page load.

**How It Works?**

- **Use Redis or Memcached** for caching **frequent query results.**
- **Example: Query caching with Redis in Python:**
    
    ```python
    python
    CopyEdit
    import redis
    import psycopg2
    import json
    
    cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
    
    def get_top_servers():
        cached_data = cache.get('top_servers')
        if cached_data:
            return json.loads(cached_data)
    
        conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=cloud_metrics user=admin password=securepass")
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("""
            SELECT server_id, AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) AS avg_cpu
            FROM aggregated_metrics
            WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
            GROUP BY server_id
            ORDER BY avg_cpu DESC
            LIMIT 10;
        """)
        result = cur.fetchall()
        cur.close()
        conn.close()
    
        cache.setex('top_servers', 3600, json.dumps(result))  # Cache for 1 hour
        return result
    
    ```
    
- **Benefits**âœ… Reduces **expensive queries** on high-traffic pages.âœ… Improves **dashboard response times** significantly.

---

### **6. Asynchronous Query Execution for Heavy Queries**

**Why It Matters?**

- Complex queries (e.g., **trend analysis over months**) can take seconds to execute.
- Running them synchronously **slows down dashboards**.

**How It Works?**

- **Run queries asynchronously** using **message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)**.
- **Example: Using Celery to offload heavy queries:**
    
    ```python
    python
    CopyEdit
    from celery import Celery
    import psycopg2
    
    app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')
    
    @app.task
    def run_heavy_query():
        conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=cloud_metrics user=admin password=securepass")
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("""
            SELECT region, AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage)
            FROM aggregated_metrics
            WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
            GROUP BY region;
        """)
        result = cur.fetchall()
        cur.close()
        conn.close()
        return result
    
    ```
    
- **Benefits**âœ… **Prevents UI slowdowns** due to expensive queries.âœ… **Ensures smooth user experience** by fetching precomputed data.
