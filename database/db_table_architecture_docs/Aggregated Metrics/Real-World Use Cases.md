# Real-World Use Cases

The **Aggregated Metric Table** plays a critical role in **predictive analytics, operational efficiency, and cost management** in cloud environments.

### **1. Cloud Cost Optimization**

- **Why It Matters?** Helps **reduce operational expenses** by identifying inefficient resource usage.
- **How It Works?**
    - Query **low-utilization servers** with consistently low CPU, memory, or network usage.
    - Identify **over-provisioned servers** running well below capacity.
    - Recommend **instance right-sizing** to downscale resources or migrate to cheaper tiers.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT server_id, AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) AS avg_cpu
    FROM aggregated_metrics
    WHERE hourly_avg_cpu_usage < 20
    GROUP BY server_id;
    
    ```
    
    - Helps teams **deallocate idle instances** to optimize cloud spend.

### **2. Anomaly Detection & Proactive Issue Resolution**

- **Why It Matters?** Detects **unexpected performance degradation** before incidents occur.
- **How It Works?**
    - Identify **spikes in peak network or disk usage** beyond normal thresholds.
    - Detect **CPU/memory saturation trends** that deviate from historical patterns.
    - Alert engineers about **potential outages** before they affect end-users.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT server_id, hourly_avg_cpu_usage
    FROM aggregated_metrics
    WHERE hourly_avg_cpu_usage > (SELECT AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) * 1.5 FROM aggregated_metrics);
    
    ```
    
    - Detects **CPU spikes exceeding 50% of historical averages** for anomaly alerts.

### **3. Load Balancing Insights**

- **Why It Matters?** Ensures **even distribution of workloads** across data centers.
- **How It Works?**
    - Analyze **regional performance trends** to optimize cloud resource allocation.
    - Prevent **server overloads** by dynamically shifting workloads.
    - Improve **auto-scaling efficiency** by basing scaling policies on **historical trends** rather than real-time spikes.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT region, AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) AS avg_cpu, AVG(hourly_avg_memory_usage) AS avg_mem
    FROM aggregated_metrics
    GROUP BY region
    ORDER BY avg_cpu DESC;
    
    ```
    
    - Helps teams **distribute workloads** based on real-time and historical performance.

### **4. SLA Monitoring & Compliance Tracking**

- **Why It Matters?** Ensures cloud providers **meet uptime guarantees** (e.g., 99.9%).
- **How It Works?**
    - Compare **uptime percentages** across servers and regions.
    - Generate **compliance reports** for auditing purposes.
    - Alert teams when **uptime drops below contractual guarantees**.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT server_id, uptime_percentage
    FROM aggregated_metrics
    WHERE uptime_percentage < 99.9;
    
    ```
    
    - Identifies servers **failing SLA agreements**, helping prevent penalties.

### **5. Capacity Planning & Future Resource Forecasting**

- **Why It Matters?** Avoids **over-provisioning (wasting money) or under-provisioning (causing slowdowns)**.
- **How It Works?**
    - Predict **future CPU, memory, and network demands** based on usage trends.
    - Identify **seasonal performance patterns** to prepare for high-demand periods.
    - Improve **resource allocation strategies** based on projected growth.
- **Example Query:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', timestamp) AS month, AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) AS avg_cpu
    FROM aggregated_metrics
    GROUP BY month
    ORDER BY month;
    
    ```
    
    - Tracks **CPU trends over time** to forecast future resource needs.

### **Takeaways**

The **Aggregated Metric Table** serves as a **foundation for automation, cost reduction, and intelligent resource management**. These use cases show how **querying pre-computed aggregated data** enables **fast, real-time insights** that drive **smarter decision-making** in cloud operations.
