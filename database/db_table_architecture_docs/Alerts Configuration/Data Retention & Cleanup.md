# Data Retention & Cleanup

1. **Archive Old Configurations After a Period of Inactivity**
    - **Why**: As time passes, alert configurations that are no longer in use or relevant accumulate. These outdated configurations occupy valuable storage space and can lead to decreased query performance. Archiving old configurations reduces the size of the active dataset and helps maintain system efficiency.
    - **How**: Set up a retention policy that automatically archives alert configurations that have been inactive (e.g., not triggered or modified) for a specified period, such as 6 months or 1 year. These archived configurations can be stored in an external storage system, like AWS S3 or a cold storage solution.
    - **Impact**: Archiving inactive configurations helps keep the operational database lean and efficient. The system remains performant while still allowing for historical alert data to be retained in a separate, more cost-effective storage solution.
2. **Regularly Review and Remove Outdated Configurations**
    - **Why**: Inactive or outdated alert configurations, such as those associated with deprecated metrics, obsolete servers, or no longer relevant notification rules, can clutter the system and make management difficult.
    - **How**: Implement a review process where alert configurations are evaluated periodically for relevance. Use automated tools or scripts to identify and delete or archive configurations that meet criteria for being outdated, such as unused `metric_name`, expired `server_id`, or no longer valid `contact_email`.
    - **Impact**: Regular review and cleanup ensure the alert system remains streamlined and focused on current operations. It reduces unnecessary data processing and storage costs, while also making it easier for administrators to manage active configurations.
3. **Implement Soft Deletion with Archival for Configurations Marked as Deleted**
    - **Why**: Rather than permanently deleting configurations, it is safer to implement soft deletion, which allows data to be removed from active queries but retained in the system for audit purposes.
    - **How**: Add a `deleted_at` timestamp field or `is_deleted` flag to the `alerts_configuration` table. When configurations are no longer needed, mark them as deleted but retain them for historical or audit purposes. Periodically, you can archive these deleted configurations for long-term retention.
    - **Impact**: Soft deletion provides a safety net for auditing or rollback purposes, ensuring that configurations aren't permanently lost. It also allows for better compliance with retention policies while maintaining the ability to recover data if needed.
4. **Implement TTL (Time-to-Live) for Alert Configurations**
    - **Why**: If alerts are intended to be temporary or tied to specific projects, they may no longer be relevant after the project or issue is resolved. Implementing TTL ensures that configurations automatically expire after a certain time, reducing the need for manual cleanup.
    - **How**: Use TTL mechanisms for configuration entries. For example, set a TTL of 30, 60, or 90 days on alert configurations, so that after this period, the configuration will either be deleted or archived based on business rules.
    - **Impact**: TTL simplifies data retention and cleanup, ensuring that stale or temporary alert configurations do not linger indefinitely in the system. This reduces the burden on administrators and enhances overall system efficiency.
5. **Store Deleted Configurations in Separate Tables**
    - **Why**: Instead of mixing deleted configurations with active configurations, storing them separately ensures that they do not interfere with ongoing operations, query performance, or compliance audits.
    - **How**: Implement a separate table or database schema (e.g., `alerts_configuration_deleted`) to store configurations that are marked as deleted. This table can store configurations for a defined retention period before being permanently removed.
    - **Impact**: This approach separates active data from deprecated or deleted data, improving query performance and database maintenance. It also provides a clear audit trail for deleted configurations and supports compliance with retention policies.
6. **Utilize Automated Alerts for Cleanup and Archiving**
    - **Why**: It’s important to ensure that data retention policies are consistently followed. Manual cleanup can be error-prone and inconsistent, so automation provides a more reliable solution.
    - **How**: Set up automated processes that generate alerts for configurations that should be archived or deleted based on predefined criteria (e.g., inactive for 6 months, linked to a decommissioned server). These alerts can trigger an automated cleanup script or approval process to ensure compliance.
    - **Impact**: Automated cleanup ensures that data retention policies are followed without manual intervention. It reduces administrative overhead and ensures that alert configurations are managed consistently.
7. **Leverage Data Compression for Archived Configurations**
    - **Why**: Archiving alert configurations, especially for long-term storage, can consume significant disk space. Compressing archived data can reduce storage costs while ensuring that it remains accessible for future retrieval.
    - **How**: Use data compression techniques (e.g., gzip, bzip2, or cloud storage compression features) to reduce the storage size of archived configurations. Apply this to configurations that are no longer frequently accessed but still need to be retained for regulatory or historical purposes.
    - **Impact**: Compression reduces the physical storage requirements for archived configurations, making long-term retention more cost-effective. It also ensures that the archived data is still accessible when needed for audits or compliance reviews.

By employing these strategies for **data retention and cleanup**, the **Alerts Configuration** table remains efficient and well-maintained. The system is optimized for performance while ensuring that old, outdated, or irrelevant data is effectively archived or deleted. This helps prevent unnecessary storage bloat and ensures that only useful, active configurations are being queried, improving both the system’s efficiency and compliance.
