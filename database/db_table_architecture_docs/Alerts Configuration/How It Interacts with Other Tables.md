# How It Interacts with Other Tables

1. **Joins with `server_metrics`**
    - **Purpose**: To retrieve real-time metric values (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O) for comparison against the configured thresholds in the alert settings.
    - **Why This Interaction Matters**: The `Alerts Configuration` table serves as the **threshold reference** for `server_metrics`. As metrics are captured, the system checks whether any metric exceeds the set thresholds in the `Alerts Configuration` table, triggering an alert when necessary.
    - **Example Query**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT sm.server_id, sm.metric_name, sm.metric_value, ac.threshold_value
        FROM server_metrics sm
        JOIN alerts_configuration ac ON sm.server_id = ac.server_id
        WHERE sm.metric_name = ac.metric_name
        AND sm.metric_value > ac.threshold_value;
        
        ```
        
    - **Additional Considerations**: This join allows **real-time monitoring** and comparison, ensuring that alerts are triggered only when the metric exceeds the configured threshold.
2. **Joins with `alert_history`**
    - **Purpose**: To log all the alerts that were triggered based on the alert configuration. This provides a historical record of when alerts were activated, helping to track patterns and evaluate system performance over time.
    - **Why This Interaction Matters**: The `alert_history` table stores detailed records of triggered alerts, which is crucial for auditing, performance analysis, and response tracking. By linking `Alerts Configuration` with `alert_history`, it’s possible to trace which alert configuration led to which event, providing more context to the triggered alert.
    - **Example Query**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT ah.alert_id, ah.timestamp, ac.metric_name, ac.threshold_value
        FROM alert_history ah
        JOIN alerts_configuration ac ON ah.alert_config_id = ac.alert_config_id
        WHERE ah.timestamp > '2024-01-01';
        
        ```
        
    - **Additional Considerations**: This join facilitates **historical analysis**, enabling admins to see trends in triggered alerts over time and fine-tune alert configurations based on past patterns.
3. **Links with `user_access_logs`**
    - **Purpose**: For **security-related alerts** such as unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities. By linking `Alerts Configuration` with `user_access_logs`, you can monitor specific user access patterns and trigger alerts based on abnormal activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, access from unknown IPs).
    - **Why This Interaction Matters**: This interaction is crucial for **proactive security monitoring**. By creating alerts based on user activities and correlating them with access logs, the system can notify administrators of potential breaches or misuse of resources.
    - **Example Query**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT ual.user_id, ual.access_ip, ac.threshold_value, ual.timestamp
        FROM user_access_logs ual
        JOIN alerts_configuration ac ON ual.server_id = ac.server_id
        WHERE ual.access_type = 'FAILED_LOGIN'
        AND ual.timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
        AND ual.access_ip NOT IN (SELECT allowed_ips FROM authorized_ip_addresses WHERE server_id = ual.server_id);
        
        ```
        
    - **Additional Considerations**: Integrating **security alerts** with user behavior helps in **detecting anomalies** early, such as unauthorized attempts to access sensitive data or critical servers. This is essential for both operational and security integrity.
4. **Joins with `downtime_logs`**
    - **Purpose**: To cross-reference and understand alerts triggered by server issues (e.g., downtime, high resource usage). When a server goes down, `downtime_logs` can help assess whether the downtime is linked to an alert from the `Alerts Configuration` table.
    - **Why This Interaction Matters**: By combining `downtime_logs` and `Alerts Configuration`, you can identify **root causes** of downtime events. If an alert on high CPU usage was triggered before a server went down, it might indicate that resource exhaustion caused the issue.
    - **Example Query**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT dl.server_id, dl.downtime_start, ac.metric_name, ac.threshold_value
        FROM downtime_logs dl
        JOIN alerts_configuration ac ON dl.server_id = ac.server_id
        WHERE dl.downtime_start BETWEEN ac.alert_start_time AND ac.alert_end_time;
        
        ```
        
    - **Additional Considerations**: This join can help correlate **downtime events** with server performance issues, enabling **preventative actions** based on historical performance data.
5. **Links with `incident_response_logs`**
    - **Purpose**: To link triggered alerts with the actions taken in response to those alerts. This helps track the effectiveness of responses to critical incidents and identify areas for improvement.
    - **Why This Interaction Matters**: Correlating `incident_response_logs` with `alerts_configuration` ensures that **every alert triggers a documented response**, which can then be analyzed for future improvements in incident handling.
    - **Example Query**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT irl.incident_id, irl.response_time, ac.metric_name, ac.threshold_value
        FROM incident_response_logs irl
        JOIN alerts_configuration ac ON irl.alert_config_id = ac.alert_config_id
        WHERE irl.timestamp > '2024-01-01';
        
        ```
        
    - **Additional Considerations**: By linking incident responses directly with alerts, you ensure that teams can trace back the effectiveness of their response to each triggered alert, which is critical for ongoing **incident management improvement**.
6. **Joins with `team_management`**
    - **Purpose**: To assign alert responsibilities to specific teams or individuals. By linking `Alerts Configuration` with `team_management`, it’s easier to route alerts to the appropriate team based on the **severity** of the issue or the **server** affected.
    - **Why This Interaction Matters**: This enables a **structured approach to alert management**, where alerts are sent to the correct department based on predefined rules.
    - **Example Query**:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT tm.team_id, tm.team_member, ac.alert_frequency
        FROM team_management tm
        JOIN alerts_configuration ac ON tm.team_id = ac.team_id
        WHERE ac.severity_level = 'CRITICAL';
        
        ```
        
    - **Additional Considerations**: Having clear team assignments based on alert types allows teams to react quickly and efficiently to **critical incidents**, reducing response times and improving **team workflow**.

By linking the **Alerts Configuration** table with the above-mentioned tables, the system becomes highly **integrated** and **responsive**, enabling proactive monitoring, quick response, and detailed post-event analysis. These relationships help ensure that alerts are **contextual**, **actionable**, and **strategically managed**, making the system efficient, scalable, and effective in handling complex cloud infrastructure monitoring scenarios.
