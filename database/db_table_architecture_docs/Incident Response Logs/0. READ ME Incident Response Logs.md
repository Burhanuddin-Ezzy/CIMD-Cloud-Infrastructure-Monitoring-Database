    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `TEXT` allows for flexible and detailed descriptions.
- **`resolution_time_minutes` (INTEGER)**
    - **Purpose**: Measures how long it took to resolve the incident.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to track **operational efficiency**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in **SLA compliance and improving response times**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `INTEGER` is efficient for storing time in minutes.
- **`status` (VARCHAR(50), ENUM: `Open`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`, `Escalated`)**
    - **Purpose**: Tracks the current status of an incident.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to monitor **incident progression**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Ensures **real-time tracking** of ongoing and unresolved issues.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50)` or ENUM for predefined statuses, ensuring data consistency.
- **`priority_level` (VARCHAR(20), ENUM: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`)**
    - **Purpose**: Defines the severity of the incident.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **prioritizing response efforts**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps **optimize resource allocation and escalation handling**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(20)` or ENUM to enforce predefined priority levels.
- **`incident_type` (VARCHAR(100))**
    - **Purpose**: Categorizes incidents by type (e.g., **Network Failure, Security Breach, Hardware Failure**).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **incident classification and trend analysis**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in **recurring issue detection and long-term system improvements**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(100)` for descriptive classification.
- **`root_cause` (TEXT)**
    - **Purpose**: Provides the diagnosed cause of the incident.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to **log post-mortem analysis results**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in **preventing future incidents by identifying recurring problems**.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `TEXT` allows flexibility for detailed explanations.
- **`escalation_flag` (BOOLEAN)**
    - **Purpose**: Indicates if the incident required escalation to a higher-level team.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **tracking incident severity progression**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps measure **how often incidents require escalation** and improves process efficiency.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `BOOLEAN`, as it represents a **yes/no** flag.
- **`audit_log_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to `user_access_logs`)**
    - **Purpose**: Links to system audit logs for tracking **who accessed or modified the incident details**.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for **compliance and security tracking**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps ensure **traceability and accountability** in incident handling.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` ensures referential integrity with audit logs.
