# Real-World Use Cases – Expanding Practical Applications

### **1. Incident Management – Proactively Preventing Recurring Issues**

By analyzing incident trends over time, teams can **identify frequent failures** and implement **preventative measures** before they escalate.

### **How This Works in Practice**

- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring **server failures, network outages, or software crashes** by querying historical incidents.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Compare **current incident rates** against historical baselines to spot unusual spikes.
- **Automated Preventative Actions:** If a certain **incident type exceeds a threshold**, trigger **automated mitigations** (e.g., restart servers, increase auto-scaling).

### **Example Query – Identifying the Most Frequent Incident Types**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT incident_type, COUNT(*) AS incident_count
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY incident_type
ORDER BY incident_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

```

**Use Case:** Helps teams focus on resolving **the most common root causes** (e.g., database crashes, high CPU usage).

### **Example Query – Detecting an Unusual Surge in Incidents**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS incident_date, COUNT(*) AS total_incidents
FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY incident_date
ORDER BY incident_date DESC;

```

**Use Case:** Spot unexpected **increases in incidents** and trigger alerts for investigation.

### **2. Team Performance Analysis – Measuring Response Efficiency**

Tracking which teams **resolve incidents fastest** helps in **performance benchmarking** and identifying **bottlenecks** in response workflows.

### **How This Works in Practice**

- **Benchmarking Team Performance:** Compare **average resolution times** across different response teams.
- **Identifying Bottlenecks:** Find teams that **consistently take longer** to resolve issues.
- **Rewarding High Performers:** Recognize and incentivize **fast and effective teams**.

### **Example Query – Comparing Team Performance**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT response_team_id,
       COUNT(*) AS total_incidents,
       AVG(resolution_time_minutes) AS avg_resolution_time
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY response_team_id
ORDER BY avg_resolution_time ASC;

```

**Use Case:** Identify teams that **resolve incidents the fastest** and those that need **process improvements**.

### **Example Query – Tracking Incident Workload Per Team**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT response_team_id, COUNT(*) AS assigned_incidents
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY response_team_id
ORDER BY assigned_incidents DESC;

```

**Use Case:** Helps balance workloads by **detecting overburdened teams** and reassigning tasks accordingly.

### **3. SLA Compliance Monitoring – Ensuring Timely Incident Resolution**

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define **how quickly incidents must be resolved**. Tracking SLA compliance ensures that **penalties are avoided** and customers remain satisfied.

### **How This Works in Practice**

- **Tracking Breaches:** Identify incidents **exceeding SLA time limits** for resolution.
- **Monitoring Compliance Trends:** Measure how often teams **meet or miss SLA targets**.
- **Automating Escalations:** Trigger **alerts or escalations** when incidents exceed SLA time limits.

### **Example Query – Identifying SLA Breaches**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT incident_id, response_team_id, resolution_time_minutes
FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE resolution_time_minutes > 60;  -- Assuming 60-minute SLA

```

**Use Case:** Helps IT managers **identify and address violations** before they become customer complaints.

### **Example Query – SLA Compliance Rate Per Team**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT response_team_id,
       COUNT(*) AS total_incidents,
       SUM(CASE WHEN resolution_time_minutes <= 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sla_met,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN resolution_time_minutes <= 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS sla_compliance_rate
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY response_team_id
ORDER BY sla_compliance_rate DESC;

```

**Use Case:** Tracks which teams **consistently meet SLAs** and which ones **need improvement**.

### **Other Potential Use Cases**

### **4. Financial Impact Analysis – Estimating Downtime Costs**

Incidents can cause downtime, leading to **revenue loss**. Analyzing incident logs alongside `cost_data` helps quantify **financial risks**.

### **Example Query – Calculating Downtime Costs per Incident**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT irl.incident_id, irl.server_id, irl.resolution_time_minutes, cd.cost_per_minute,
       (irl.resolution_time_minutes * cd.cost_per_minute) AS estimated_downtime_cost
FROM incident_response_logs irl
JOIN cost_data cd ON irl.server_id = cd.server_id;

```

**Use Case:** Helps prioritize **high-cost failures** and justify **investments in redundancy**.

---

### **5. Root Cause Analysis – Reducing Future Incidents**

Linking incidents to root causes allows teams to **implement preventive measures**.

### **Example Query – Most Common Root Causes**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT root_cause, COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY root_cause
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

```

**Use Case:** Identifies **recurring failure points** that need **long-term fixes**.
