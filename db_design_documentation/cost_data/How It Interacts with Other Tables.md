# How It Interacts with Other Tables

- **Joins with `resource_allocation`**: This connection helps analyze whether resource allocation patterns align with server costs. By joining on `server_id`, you can correlate resource consumption (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space) to operational cost, enabling a better understanding of whether overprovisioning or underutilization is affecting cost-efficiency.
- **Joins with `server_metrics`**: By linking the `server_id` in both tables, this join helps analyze if high costs are associated with high server utilization or if inefficiencies exist in the infrastructure. For instance, if a server's operational costs are high but its CPU or memory usage is low, it could signal underutilized resources, leading to potential cost-saving measures.
- **Joins with `billing_data`**: This join integrates cost tracking with the financial reporting system, offering a seamless way to align cost data with the organization's budget. It helps analyze the overall cost structure by combining cost-related data with the detailed financial breakdown provided in `billing_data`, allowing for budgeting, forecasting, and cost optimization strategies.
- **Joins with `error_logs`**: Linking cost data with `error_logs` can provide insights into whether high operational costs are associated with frequent errors or server issues. High error rates may indicate inefficiencies that are raising the cost without providing value.
- **Joins with `downtime_logs`**: By joining on `server_id`, you can correlate downtime events with high operational costs, helping to assess if extended downtimes are leading to unnecessary costs or whether any corrective measures are needed to optimize server availability and reduce costs.
- **Joins with `alert_history`**: Linking with `alert_history` enables a detailed analysis of how cost spikes may correlate with frequent or critical alerts, offering insights into whether alerts are being triggered due to under-resourced servers or misconfigurations.
- **Joins with `aggregated_metrics`**: Aggregating server metrics over time alongside cost data provides a high-level overview of operational cost trends in relation to key performance indicators (KPIs), such as memory usage, CPU utilization, or network traffic. This allows teams to optimize resource allocation and cost planning based on historical data.
- **Joins with `application_logs`**: By joining on `server_id`, you can link resource usage and costs to application performance. This enables detailed analysis of whether the operational costs are aligned with the specific workloads or applications running on the server.
- **Joins with `user_access_logs`**: Access logs can reveal how user activity impacts server usage and, in turn, operational costs. For example, high access rates during specific times may drive up server costs, and analyzing this relationship can help inform decisions about scaling resources.
- **Joins with `alerts_configuration`**: Integrating cost data with alert settings can provide proactive cost optimization alerts. For instance, if a server's cost exceeds a certain threshold, an alert can trigger, informing relevant teams to investigate resource usage and consider adjustments.
- **Joins with `team_management`**: Linking cost data with the `team_management` table helps allocate costs to specific departments or teams. By joining on the `team_allocation` field, you can track which departments or teams are responsible for which costs, improving financial accountability and transparency.
- **Joins with `incident_response_logs`**: By analyzing incidents and their related cost data, you can determine whether operational costs are impacted by recurring incidents or service failures. This helps to uncover the cost of managing and responding to incidents and can highlight areas for optimization or improvement.
