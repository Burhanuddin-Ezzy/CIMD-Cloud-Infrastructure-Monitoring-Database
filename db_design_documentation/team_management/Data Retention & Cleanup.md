# Data Retention & Cleanup

1. **Auto-remove Teams If Inactive for Long Periods**:
    - **Purpose**: To ensure that the database remains optimized and doesn’t become bloated with outdated or inactive team data.
    - **How It Helps**:
        - By setting up **automatic removal** of teams that have not been active for a specified period (e.g., 6 months or a year), you ensure that the system only stores relevant data. This helps prevent **data redundancy** and keeps the database **clean**.
        - Teams that haven't been assigned to any servers or haven't participated in any alerts or incidents for a set period could be flagged as inactive and marked for removal.
        - This approach ensures that your database remains **performant** over time, with only teams that actively manage resources being tracked.
    - **Considerations**:
        - You need to define clear criteria for **activity** (e.g., server assignment, participation in incidents or alerts). Simply not assigning servers might not be a good reason for removal if the team is still involved in high-level planning or monitoring.
        - Implementing a safe **soft-delete** strategy (marking teams as inactive rather than immediately deleting them) can help in case the data is needed for audits or future reference.
        - Ensure that data removal processes comply with **organizational policies** and **data retention regulations** (e.g., GDPR).
2. **Archive Old Team Assignments Instead of Deleting for Audit Purposes**:
    - **Purpose**: To maintain a historical record of past team assignments and configurations, which might be required for audits, regulatory purposes, or internal investigations.
    - **How It Helps**:
        - Instead of completely deleting team assignment records, you can **archive them** in a separate table or storage system. This approach provides **long-term accessibility** to historical data while ensuring that the active database is kept optimized and focused on current data.
        - Archived data can be moved to more **cost-efficient storage solutions**, such as cloud-based **data lakes** or **cold storage**, and can still be easily retrieved when needed.
        - Archiving ensures that **historical context** is preserved for teams and server assignments, which could be valuable when auditing the **evolution of infrastructure** or understanding past incidents.
    - **Considerations**:
        - **Access controls** should be in place to prevent unauthorized access to archived data, especially if it contains sensitive information.
        - The archive process should be automated to reduce manual intervention and to ensure that old data is archived regularly, without gaps or delays.
        - **Searchability** and **retrieval** of archived records should be optimized to avoid difficulties when trying to access past team assignments.
        - Depending on the size of the data and the archiving frequency, archived records may require additional **compression** or **indexing** to remain efficient for retrieval.
3. **Implementing Data Lifecycle Management Policies**:
    - **Purpose**: To provide clear rules and automated workflows for data retention, cleanup, and archival processes.
    - **How It Helps**:
        - **Data lifecycle management (DLM)** ensures that data is retained only for as long as necessary and in compliance with company policies and regulatory requirements.
        - Policies can specify when data should be archived, deleted, or moved to a different storage tier (e.g., cold storage for inactive records).
        - This process ensures consistency in how long data is retained and when it’s eligible for archiving or removal.
    - **Considerations**:
        - DLM policies need to be well-defined in collaboration with the legal, compliance, and IT teams to avoid conflicts with data retention laws (e.g., financial records, audit trails).
        - **Automating** this process through tools that can track data age and status, and automatically handle archival or deletion processes, can ensure that teams don’t miss retention deadlines.
4. **Retention of Data for Compliance or Historical Reporting**:
    - **Purpose**: To keep certain data points for a longer time due to **compliance requirements** (e.g., for auditing or regulatory purposes) or for future **historical reporting**.
    - **How It Helps**:
        - Certain **critical team assignment** records (such as configurations or alerts) might need to be stored for a longer period than others, due to regulations like **SOX** or **GDPR**. Ensuring these records are archived appropriately ensures compliance.
        - Similarly, retaining certain data for **historical analysis** can provide insights into how infrastructure and team roles have evolved over time.
    - **Considerations**:
        - You will need to identify **compliance requirements** and assess the retention needs of different types of data, determining how long each data type should be stored.
        - **Audit trails** might be necessary for tracking changes made to archived data, so you can prove compliance if requested.
5. **Retention and Cleanup for Cost Management**:
    - **Purpose**: To manage the retention of financial or resource allocation data and ensure that older, less relevant data is properly archived or deleted to avoid unnecessary storage costs.
    - **How It Helps**:
        - In teams with **cost allocation**, it’s important to ensure that cost-related data is kept for a period that makes sense for analysis and forecasting, but does not unnecessarily impact storage costs.
        - Older data (e.g., cost-related to past projects) can be archived after a certain period, allowing more relevant data (e.g., current projects or resource utilization) to be prioritized.
    - **Considerations**:
        - Establish clear policies on how long to retain financial or allocation data before moving it to archival storage or deleting it, ensuring that the business and compliance needs are met.

By applying these strategies to **data retention and cleanup**, you can ensure that your system remains scalable and optimized, while still adhering to compliance regulations and business needs for data access and retention.
