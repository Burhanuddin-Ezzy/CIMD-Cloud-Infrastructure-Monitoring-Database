# Cost Data

The **Cost Data** table contains a comprehensive set of data points for tracking the operational costs of servers, though there are some possible additional data points or refinements that could be considered depending on your specific use case. Here's a breakdown of the existing columns and whether any additional ones might be needed:

- **`server_id` (UUID, Foreign Key)**
    - **Purpose**: Identifies the server whose cost is being tracked.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: The cost must be linked to specific servers to ensure accurate tracking.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: It ensures each cost record corresponds to a unique server, facilitating detailed cost analysis per server.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` ensures global uniqueness and compatibility with other tables that reference `server_id`, providing consistency across the database.
- **`region` (VARCHAR(20))**
    - **Purpose**: Captures the geographical location of the server, which influences pricing models.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Cloud providers often have different pricing for different regions, so tracking the region is essential for accurate cost assessment.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in cost analysis by enabling comparison of pricing between different regions and adjusting for any regional pricing disparities.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(20)` is ideal for region codes (e.g., `us-east-1`), which are short and non-numeric.
- **`timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)**
    - **Purpose**: Captures when the cost calculation was made.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Necessary for tracking cost changes over time and identifying trends or patterns.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables time-series analysis and trend identification, which is crucial for budgeting and forecasting.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `TIMESTAMP` ensures precise recording of the date and time, which is essential for financial tracking.
- **`cost_per_hour` (DECIMAL(10,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the hourly operational cost of the server.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: This is essential for calculating total costs dynamically based on the serverâ€™s runtime.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Provides real-time cost tracking, making it easier to compute total costs over various periods and optimize server resource allocation.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(10,2)` is ideal for precise financial calculations, ensuring accuracy in the cost value.
- **`total_monthly_cost` (DECIMAL(10,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Represents the aggregated cost of the server over a month.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: This helps avoid recalculating costs frequently and provides a quick snapshot of monthly expenses.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Improves efficiency in reporting and cost analysis by providing an easy-to-access monthly total without the need for complex queries.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(10,2)` ensures financial figures are accurate, especially for aggregating costs at a monthly level.
- **`team_allocation` (VARCHAR(50))**

    - **Purpose**: Assigns the cost responsibility to a specific team or department.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for internal billing and budget allocation within organizations that have multiple teams or departments sharing infrastructure.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Ensures accountability and transparency in cost distribution, helping with departmental budgets and financial tracking.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50)` allows flexibility in naming departments, giving enough space to store team or department identifiers.
- **`cost_per_day` (DECIMAL(10,2))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the daily operational cost of the server.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Some use cases require daily cost tracking for more granular financial management. This could be useful in environments with fluctuating usage or for organizations that track costs on a daily basis.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Provides an additional layer of granularity to the cost tracking, enabling daily reporting alongside hourly and monthly figures.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(10,2)` ensures precision in cost calculations, suitable for representing daily costs in a financial context.
- **`cost_type` (VARCHAR(50))**
    - **Purpose**: Classifies the type of cost (e.g., infrastructure, software licensing, cloud services).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: In complex cost tracking systems, it might be necessary to track various types of costs to understand where the majority of expenses come from.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps break down cost data into more detailed categories, providing insights into cost distribution and helping with financial analysis.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50)` allows flexibility in defining cost types, which may vary across departments or use cases.
- **`cost_adjustment` (DECIMAL(10,2))**

    - **Purpose**: Captures any adjustments made to the cost, such as discounts or promotions.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Adjustments are often part of cost tracking, such as promotional discounts or custom billing arrangements that reduce the cost.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Allows for tracking modifications in cost, ensuring more accurate financial records.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `DECIMAL(10,2)` provides precise financial calculations for adjustments, ensuring accurate cost tracking.
- **`cost_adjustment_reason`**
- **`cost_basis` (VARCHAR(50))**
    - **Purpose**: Defines how the cost is calculated, e.g., per usage, flat-rate, or based on allocated resources.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Cost can be calculated in various ways depending on the provider or infrastructure, so clarifying the method is important for transparency.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Provides clarity on the calculation method, improving understanding of how costs are derived and supporting accurate financial reporting.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50)` is suitable for a brief description of the cost calculation method, with enough space to accommodate different calculation types.
