# Advanced Query Optimization Techniques

As the **incident response logs** table grows, query performance becomes **a major concern**. Large datasets can lead to **slow retrieval times**, especially when running analytics and aggregations. Hereâ€™s how we can **optimize queries for performance and scalability**.

---

## **1. Using Indexed Lookups for Fast Query Execution**

### **Why Indexing is Essential?**

Indexes **speed up searches** by reducing the number of rows scanned. Without indexes, queries will **scan the entire table**, leading to slow response times.

### **Optimizing Lookups with Indexes**

### **1.1 Indexing `server_id` for Faster Incident Retrieval**

- **Problem:** Finding incidents for a specific server can be slow if the table has **millions of records**.
- **Solution:** Create an **index on `server_id`** to speed up server-specific queries.
- **Example Query It Helps:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT * FROM incident_response_logs
    WHERE server_id = 'srv-101';
    
    ```
    
- **Index Implementation:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE INDEX idx_server_id ON incident_response_logs (server_id);
    
    ```
    

### **1.2 Indexing `response_team_id` to Optimize Team-Based Queries**

- **Problem:** Queries that analyze team performance will scan **every row** unless indexed.
- **Solution:** An **index on `response_team_id`** speeds up filtering incidents by team.
- **Example Query It Helps:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT * FROM incident_response_logs
    WHERE response_team_id = 'team-001';
    
    ```
    
- **Index Implementation:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE INDEX idx_response_team ON incident_response_logs (response_team_id);
    
    ```
    

### **1.3 Composite Index for `server_id` and `timestamp`**

- **Problem:** Querying incidents by **both server and time range** can be slow.
- **Solution:** A **composite index (`server_id`, `timestamp`)** improves time-based lookups per server.
- **Example Query It Helps:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    SELECT * FROM incident_response_logs
    WHERE server_id = 'srv-101' AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
    
    ```
    
- **Index Implementation:**
    
    ```sql
    sql
    CopyEdit
    CREATE INDEX idx_server_time ON incident_response_logs (server_id, timestamp DESC);
    
    ```

## **2. Using Materialized Views for Expensive Aggregations**

### **Why Materialized Views?**

- Queries that **calculate averages or counts over millions of records** are expensive.
- Instead of recalculating data **each time**, we **precompute the results** in a **Materialized View**.

### **Example: Precomputing Average Resolution Time Per Team**

### **Expensive Query Without Optimization**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT response_team_id, AVG(resolution_time_minutes) AS avg_resolution_time
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY response_team_id;

```

Each time this query runs, it **scans the entire table**, causing **performance issues**.

### **Optimized Query Using a Materialized View**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW team_avg_resolution AS
SELECT response_team_id, AVG(resolution_time_minutes) AS avg_resolution_time
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY response_team_id;

```

Now, we can query the **precomputed data** instead:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT * FROM team_avg_resolution;

```

To refresh the data periodically:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW team_avg_resolution;

```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:** Instead of scanning millions of rows **every time**, we update this view **only when needed**.

---

## **3. Pre-Aggregated Reports for Long-Term Trends**

### **Why Use Pre-Aggregation?**

- **Long-term trend analysis** (e.g., monthly incident counts) involves large dataset scans.
- We can **store precomputed summaries** in a **separate table** to **reduce query overhead**.

### **Example: Storing Monthly Incident Counts in a Summary Table**

### **Query Thatâ€™s Too Expensive to Run Repeatedly**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', timestamp) AS incident_month,
       COUNT(*) AS total_incidents
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY incident_month;

```

Each execution scans **all incident records**, making it **slow**.

### **Solution: Store Monthly Aggregates in a Table**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE TABLE incident_summary (
    incident_month DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    total_incidents INTEGER
);

```

Populate the table with precomputed values:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
INSERT INTO incident_summary (incident_month, total_incidents)
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', timestamp), COUNT(*)
FROM incident_response_logs
GROUP BY 1;

```

Now, we can query this **summary table** instead of the full dataset:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT * FROM incident_summary WHERE incident_month >= '2025-01-01';

```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:** This avoids scanning **millions of records** every time someone needs a report.

## **4. Query Optimization with Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**

### **Why Use CTEs?**

- CTEs improve readability and optimize execution by **breaking down complex queries** into steps.
- PostgreSQL can **optimize CTEs by materializing the intermediate results**.

### **Example: Breaking Down an Incident Analysis Query**

### **Inefficient Query (Without CTEs)**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT response_team_id, COUNT(*) AS total_responses,
       AVG(resolution_time_minutes) AS avg_resolution_time
FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY response_team_id
ORDER BY avg_resolution_time;

```

ðŸ’¡ **Problem:** The `WHERE` filter and `GROUP BY` operation force a **full table scan**.

### **Optimized Query Using a CTE**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
WITH recent_incidents AS (
    SELECT response_team_id, resolution_time_minutes
    FROM incident_response_logs
    WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
)
SELECT response_team_id, COUNT(*) AS total_responses,
       AVG(resolution_time_minutes) AS avg_resolution_time
FROM recent_incidents
GROUP BY response_team_id
ORDER BY avg_resolution_time;

```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:**

- The CTE **filters recent data first**, reducing the rows processed by the aggregation.

---

## **5. Using JSONB Indexing for Structured Incident Data**

### **Why Use JSONB?**

- If incident details contain **structured JSON data**, we can **index specific keys** to optimize queries.

### **Example: Storing Incident Metadata in JSONB**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
ALTER TABLE incident_response_logs
ADD COLUMN incident_details JSONB;

```

ðŸ’¡ **Querying JSONB Data Without an Index is Slow**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT * FROM incident_response_logs
WHERE incident_details->>'severity' = 'Critical';

```

ðŸ’¡ **Solution: Create a GIN Index for JSONB**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE INDEX idx_incident_details ON incident_response_logs USING GIN (incident_details);

```

Now, queries filtering by JSON keys are **much faster**.

---

## **6. Optimizing Bulk Inserts and Updates**

### **Problem: High Insert/Update Latency**

- **Bulk inserts/updates** can cause **lock contention** and slow down **real-time queries**.

### **Optimized Approach â€“ Using Batch Inserts**

Instead of inserting **one row at a time**:

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
INSERT INTO incident_response_logs (incident_id, server_id, timestamp, response_team_id, incident_summary)
VALUES ('uuid-1', 'srv-001', '2025-02-18 10:00:00', 'team-101', 'High CPU usage detected');

```

ðŸ’¡ **Use Batch Inserts Instead:**

```sql
sql
CopyEdit
INSERT INTO incident_response_logs (incident_id, server_id, timestamp, response_team_id, incident_summary)
VALUES
('uuid-1', 'srv-001', '2025-02-18 10:00:00', 'team-101', 'High CPU usage detected'),
('uuid-2', 'srv-002', '2025-02-18 10:05:00', 'team-102', 'Network failure detected'),
('uuid-3', 'srv-003', '2025-02-18 10:10:00', 'team-103', 'Disk failure detected');

```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:** **Reduces insert overhead** and speeds up performance.
