# Difference Between resource_tag and workload_type

| **Column** | **Purpose** | **Scope** | **Example Values** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`workload_type`** | Defines what **type of task** the application is running. | **Application-level** (What the app does) | `"Web Server"`, `"Database"`, `"ML Training"` |
| **`resource_tag`** | Categorizes the **purpose** of the resource (e.g., who owns it, what project it belongs to). | **Business-level** (Who/what it's for) | `"Finance Team"`, `"AI Research"`, `"Staging Environment"` |

### **Key Differences**

- `workload_type` is about **how** the resource is used (technical role).
- `resource_tag` is about **why** the resource exists (business purpose).

üí° **Example:**

- If a server is hosting a **web application for marketing**, it might have:
    - `workload_type = "Web Server"`
    - `resource_tag = "Marketing Team"`
- If a server is **processing machine learning models for AI research**, it might have:
    - `workload_type = "ML Training"`
    - `resource_tag = "AI Research"`

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Is `resource_tag` Labeling the Entire Server or Just the Resources?**

You're **right to ask this!** The way it's written might make it seem like a single server is assigned to a specific team or project, but that's **not necessarily the case**.

**`resource_tag` applies to specific allocated resources within a server, not the whole server.**

A single **server** can have **multiple resource allocations**, each tagged differently.

### **Example: A Shared Server with Multiple Applications**

Let‚Äôs say **Server-1** is a powerful machine hosting multiple applications. It has the following resource allocations:

| `server_id` | `app_id` | `workload_type` | `allocated_cpu` | `resource_tag` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Server-1` | `App-A` | `"Database"` | `4 Cores` | `"Finance Team"` |
| `Server-1` | `App-B` | `"Web Server"` | `2 Cores` | `"Marketing Team"` |
| `Server-1` | `App-C` | `"ML Training"` | `6 Cores` | `"AI Research"` |

üìù **Takeaways:**

- **Same server (`Server-1`)** is used for **multiple workloads** (`Database`, `Web Server`, `ML Training`).
- Different applications running **on the same server** can have **different `resource_tag` values**.
- This allows **cost tracking per department/project**, even if multiple teams share the same physical/virtual infrastructure.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ What If a Server is Dedicated to One Task?**

If a server is **dedicated** to a single purpose, then `resource_tag` and `workload_type` might **be closely related**.

üí° **Example:**

- A server **exclusively running an AI training model**:
    - `workload_type = "ML Training"`
    - `resource_tag = "AI Research"`

This makes sense if the entire machine is provisioned for a single purpose.

---

### **Final Answer to Your Question**

- `resource_tag` is **not assuming a single server is for a single task.**
- It **labels specific resource allocations within a server** for tracking purposes.
- `workload_type` explains **what the allocated resources are doing**, while `resource_tag` explains **who/what the resources are for**.

### **Do You Need Both Columns?**

**Yes, because they serve different purposes:**

- **`workload_type`** helps you understand the **technical** usage.
- **`resource_tag`** helps you track **business-related** ownership.
