# Performance Considerations & Scalability

The **Aggregated Metric Table** needs to handle **large-scale time-series data** efficiently while ensuring **fast queries** and **scalability**. Below are critical **performance optimizations** to ensure real-time insights without query bottlenecks.

### **1. Partitioning for Faster Query Performance**

- **Why It Matters?**
    - Improves query efficiency by scanning only relevant partitions.
    - Reduces index bloat and speeds up **time-based queries**.
- **How It Works?**
    - **Partitioning by `region`**: Ensures queries targeting specific geographical locations execute faster.
    - **Partitioning by `timestamp` (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly)**: Reduces query time for historical analysis.
    - **Example PostgreSQL Partitioning Strategy:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE aggregated_metrics (
            server_id UUID NOT NULL,
            region VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
            hourly_avg_cpu_usage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
            hourly_avg_memory_usage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
            peak_network_usage BIGINT NOT NULL,
            peak_disk_usage BIGINT NOT NULL,
            uptime_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
            timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
        ) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);
        
        ```
        
        - Enables efficient **time-range queries** by only scanning relevant partitions.

### **2. Materialized Views for Pre-Aggregated Reports**

- **Why It Matters?**
    - Aggregating metrics on-the-fly is expensive, especially over large datasets.
    - **Materialized views** store pre-computed results, reducing query execution time.
- **How It Works?**
    - Create **materialized views** for **common aggregation queries**, such as **average CPU/memory usage per region per day**.
    - Refresh the views at **regular intervals** instead of running costly aggregations in real-time.
    - **Example Materialized View:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_avg_metrics AS
        SELECT server_id, region, DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day,
               AVG(hourly_avg_cpu_usage) AS avg_cpu,
               AVG(hourly_avg_memory_usage) AS avg_mem,
               MAX(peak_network_usage) AS max_network,
               MAX(peak_disk_usage) AS max_disk,
               AVG(uptime_percentage) AS avg_uptime
        FROM aggregated_metrics
        GROUP BY server_id, region, day;
        
        ```
        
        - Queries on **daily trends** will now **use this pre-aggregated table** instead of scanning raw data.
        - **Fast lookups** with minimal CPU overhead.
        - Refresh strategy:
            
            ```sql
            sql
            CopyEdit
            REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_avg_metrics WITH DATA;
            
            ```
            
            - Run **daily or hourly** via **cron jobs** or database triggers.

### **3. Indexing for SLA Monitoring & Query Optimization**

- **Why It Matters?**
    - Indexing speeds up query lookups, especially for **high-frequency queries** like SLA tracking and resource utilization.
- **How It Works?**
    - **Index `server_id` for fast lookups of individual server metrics.**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_server_id ON aggregated_metrics(server_id);
        
        ```
        
    - **Index `uptime_percentage` to quickly identify SLA violations.**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_uptime_percentage ON aggregated_metrics(uptime_percentage);
        
        ```
        
    - **Index `region` for geographical queries and comparisons.**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_region ON aggregated_metrics(region);
        
        ```
        
    - **Index `timestamp` to optimize time-range queries.**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON aggregated_metrics(timestamp DESC);
        
        ```
        
        - Helps **quickly filter** by **recent metrics** without scanning old data.

### **4. Compression & Data Retention Strategies**

- **Why It Matters?**
    - Long-term storage of **aggregated data** can **consume massive disk space**.
    - **Older data is less frequently queried**, so **compressing or offloading** it can optimize storage.
- **How It Works?**
    - **Use PostgreSQLâ€™s `pg_compress`** to store less frequently accessed records in a compressed format.
    - **Move older data to cold storage** after 6 months (e.g., AWS Glacier, Google BigQuery, or a data warehouse like Snowflake).
    - **Example Data Archival Query:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        INSERT INTO aggregated_metrics_archive
        SELECT * FROM aggregated_metrics WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
        
        DELETE FROM aggregated_metrics WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
        
        ```
        
    - Keeps the primary table **lightweight** for **fast real-time analysis** while preserving historical data.

### **5. Asynchronous Batch Processing for Heavy Aggregations**

- **Why It Matters?**
    - **Avoids slowing down real-time queries** by running expensive aggregations asynchronously.
- **How It Works?**
    - Instead of aggregating **every time a query is run**, **schedule batch jobs** to process data at intervals.
    - Use **background workers** (e.g., Celery, PostgreSQLâ€™s pg_cron, or Apache Airflow) to handle this.
    - **Example Cron Job for Aggregation Processing:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        SELECT pg_cron.schedule('0 * * * *', $$ REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_avg_metrics $$);
        
        ```
        
        - Runs every **hour**, updating **pre-aggregated data** without user intervention.

### **6. Sharding for High-Scale Distributed Workloads**

- **Why It Matters?**
    - Prevents performance bottlenecks in **large-scale, multi-region deployments**.
- **How It Works?**
    - **Shard by `region`** to ensure queries **only scan relevant data partitions**.
    - **Shard by `server_id`** if managing **millions of servers** in a cloud infrastructure.
    - **Example Table Sharding Strategy:**
        
        ```sql
        sql
        CopyEdit
        CREATE TABLE aggregated_metrics_us PARTITION OF aggregated_metrics
        FOR VALUES IN ('us-east-1', 'us-west-2');
        
        CREATE TABLE aggregated_metrics_eu PARTITION OF aggregated_metrics
        FOR VALUES IN ('eu-west-1', 'eu-central-1');
        
        ```
        
    - This **prevents queries from scanning irrelevant data** when retrieving server metrics.
