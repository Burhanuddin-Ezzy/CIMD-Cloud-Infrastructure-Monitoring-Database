# Downtime Logs

This table records and tracks server downtime events, crucial for reliability monitoring, SLA compliance, and root cause analysis. By capturing the start and end times of downtime, its cause, and its impact on service-level agreements (SLAs), this table helps optimize system uptime, reduce failures, and improve response strategies.

### **Data Points (Columns) – Purpose, Thought Process, and Data Type**

- **`server_id` (UUID, Foreign Key)**
    
    **Purpose**: Links the downtime event to the affected server.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Essential for tracking downtime per server.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in identifying unreliable servers and planning maintenance.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` as it matches `server_id` in the **Server Metrics** table for joins.
    
- **`start_time` (TIMESTAMP)**
    
    **Purpose**: Marks the beginning of a downtime event.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to calculate total downtime duration.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in analyzing when downtimes commonly occur.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `TIMESTAMP` for precise event tracking.
    
- **`end_time` (TIMESTAMP, Nullable)**
    
    **Purpose**: Marks when the downtime event ended.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Required to measure downtime duration.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Identifies servers with prolonged outages.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `TIMESTAMP NULL` (null if still down, otherwise records end time).
    
- **`downtime_duration_minutes` (INTEGER, Generated Column)**
    
    **Purpose**: Stores total downtime duration in minutes.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Reduces query complexity when calculating downtime.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Directly provides downtime length for SLA calculations.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time)) / 60) STORED`, ensuring automatic calculation.
    
- **`downtime_cause` (VARCHAR(255))**
    
    **Purpose**: Describes why the downtime occurred (e.g., hardware failure, software crash).
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for diagnosing recurring issues.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in preventive maintenance and risk analysis.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(255)`, balancing storage efficiency and readability.
    
- **`sla_tracking` (BOOLEAN)**
    
    **Purpose**: Indicates whether this downtime event impacted the SLA.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: SLAs require strict uptime monitoring.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in ensuring contractual obligations are met.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `BOOLEAN`, as it’s a simple yes/no condition.
    
- **`incident_id` (UUID, Foreign Key, Nullable)**
    
    **Purpose**: Links the downtime event to an incident report in the `incident_management` table.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed for connecting downtime events with resolution workflows.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in tracking remediation steps and identifying recurring failures.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID NULL`, allowing optional linkage to an incident record.
    
- **`is_planned` (BOOLEAN)**
    
    **Purpose**: Differentiates between **planned maintenance** and **unexpected outages**.
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Planned maintenance doesn’t count against SLA violations.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps in SLA tracking and reporting accurate downtime statistics.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `BOOLEAN`, as it’s a simple true/false condition.
    
- **`recovery_action` (VARCHAR(255))**
    
    **Purpose**: Stores the action taken to restore the server (e.g., reboot, hardware replacement).
    
    **How I Thought of Including It**: Helps in identifying effective recovery strategies.
    
    **Why I Thought of Including It**: Allows post-mortem analysis to improve uptime.
    
    **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(255)`, providing flexibility for storing descriptions.
