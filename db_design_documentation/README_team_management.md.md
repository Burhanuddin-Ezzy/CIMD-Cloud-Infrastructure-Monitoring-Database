# Team Management

This table tracks **teams, their members, and their assigned servers** in a cloud infrastructure setup. It ensures **clear responsibility allocation**, **efficient server management**, and **seamless collaboration** among different teams like DevOps, Engineering, and IT Security.

### **Data Points (Columns) – Purpose, Thought Process, and Data Type**

- **`team_id` (UUID, Primary Key)**
    - **Purpose**: Uniquely identifies each team.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to **differentiate teams** managing different resources.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Allows easy reference to teams in other tables (e.g., cost tracking, alerts).
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` ensures uniqueness across distributed systems.
- **`team_name` (VARCHAR(100))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the name of the team responsible for certain servers.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: To provide a **human-readable identifier** instead of just `team_id`.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Makes queries and reports more user-friendly.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(100)` is sufficient for most team names without excessive storage use.
- **`member_id` (UUID, Foreign Key)**
    - **Purpose**: Links team members to their respective teams.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to **assign individual members** to a team.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables tracking **which members belong to which team** for accountability.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` ensures unique and consistent referencing
- **`role` (VARCHAR(50))**
    - **Purpose**: Defines the role of the member (e.g., Engineer, DevOps, Manager).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to define **permissions and responsibilities** within a team.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps determine **who has authority over certain tasks** (e.g., managers vs. engineers).
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(50)` is enough to store role names.
- **`email` (VARCHAR(255))**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the contact email of the team or individual members.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: To facilitate **communication and alerting**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Enables notifications for alerts, escalations, or team coordination.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(255)` follows email format conventions.
- **`assigned_server_ids` (JSON or Separate Table)**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the list of servers assigned to a team.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Required for tracking **which team is responsible for which servers**.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Critical for resource ownership and accountability.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**:
        - **Option 1: JSON** (e.g., `["srv-123", "srv-456"]`) for flexibility.
        - **Option 2: Separate linking table (`team_server_assignment`)** for **better normalization and querying efficiency**.
- **`team_lead_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to `member_id`)**
    - **Purpose**: Designates the lead or manager of the team.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to identify a **clear point of contact** for team management and escalation purposes.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Teams typically need a designated lead for decision-making and coordination with other teams.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `UUID` ensures the lead’s unique identity and links it directly to a member.
- **`team_description` (TEXT)**
    - **Purpose**: Provides a brief description of the team’s focus and responsibilities.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: To provide **context** on what each team is responsible for in the infrastructure.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Makes team management clearer, especially when dealing with larger teams or cross-functional teams.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `TEXT` allows for a detailed description without any length restrictions.
- **`date_created` (TIMESTAMP)**
    - **Purpose**: Tracks when the team was created.
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: This can provide insight into the **team’s tenure** within the organization and track team setup history.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Useful for auditing purposes, team lifecycle tracking, or for providing historical context on team formation.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `TIMESTAMP` captures precise creation times, useful for sorting or querying teams based on their creation date.
- **`status` (VARCHAR(20))**
    - **Purpose**: Tracks whether the team is **active** or **inactive** (e.g., in the case of decommissioning or reorganization).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Teams may change status during lifecycle events (e.g., project completion, reorganization).
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: Helps track the operational status of a team, enabling accurate reporting and auditing.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(20)` can store values such as “Active,” “Inactive,” “Pending,” etc.
- **`location` (VARCHAR(100))**
    - **Purpose**: Indicates the physical or virtual location of the team (e.g., “New York Data Center,” “Remote”).
    - **How I Thought of Including It**: Needed to handle teams that might operate across various geographical or virtual locations.
    - **Why I Thought of Including It**: As cloud infrastructure often involves distributed teams, having this data can be helpful for coordinating operations, especially across multiple time zones.
    - **Data Type Used & Why**: `VARCHAR(100)` is sufficient for short location strings, with flexibility for longer location names or descriptions.
